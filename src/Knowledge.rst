Classification
================================================================================

Acquaintance & Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knowledge by acquaintance is knowledge obtained through direct perception.

*   One's self
*   Pain

Knowledge by description is knowledge obtained through mediated perception or
inference.

*   The center of mass of the universe
*   Physical objects
*   Past events
*   Future states of affairs
*   Another person's mind

Note: All thinking has to start from acquaintance; but it succeeds in thinking
about many things with which we have no acquaintance.

Propositional & Technical
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Propositional knowledge is "knowledge-that".

Declarative & Procedural
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Either knowledge is declarative (explicit) or knowledge is procedural (tacit).

There are different kinds of knowledge in relation to the kinds of question we
can ask.

Knowing _where_ something is is a different kind of knowledge then knowing _how_
to do something or _why_ something works.

Tacit vs. Explicit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knowledge is tacit iff it cannot be communicated.

*   Natural language
*   Riding a bike

Knowledge is explicit iff it can be articulated, codified, and stored in media.

*   Textbooks
*   Manuals

## Mediate & Immediate

Knowledge is mediated iff ...

* Past experience and reflection enables us to recognize things in the stream
  of impressions.

Knowledge is immediate iff it was gained without proof by a direct contemplate
of truth.


---

Knowledge can include:

- Facts
- Information
- Descriptions
- Skills

We can never gain true knowledge of things.

When we study something, we only can know _about_ it. Understanding is a matter
of _description_ not truth. Everything reduces to metaphor. All knowledge is
constructed. Speculation is king.

Ultimately, knowledge reduces to ascertaining the truth of various propositions.
