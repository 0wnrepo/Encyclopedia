Wisdom
================================================================================

Wisdom is the right use of knowledge.

Wisdom is the capacity to realize what is of value in life for oneself and
others (and thus including knowledge, know-how and understand).[1]

Wisdom is the capacity to realize (apprehend and create) what is of value in
life, for oneself and others, wisdom thus including knowledge and
technologicalknow-how but much else besides.[1]

Wisdom is the understanding of causes (knowing why things are a certain way)
which is deeper than merely knowing that things are a certain way.[2]

A massive increase in scientific knowledge and technology without a concomitant
increase in wisdom leads to problems.

* Environmental degradation

* War

* Population growth

* AIDS

Scientific knowledge increases our power to act.[1] In the absence of wisdom,
knowledge will have beneficial consequences and harmful consequences.[1]

We are not suffering from too much reason but not enough.[1] Knowledge inquiry
is profoundly irrational when judged from the standpoint of contributing to
human welfare.[1] Scientific rationality merely poses as rationality.

Knowledge inquiry demands a sharp split between social and humanitarian aims and
the intellectual aim. The intellectual aim is to acquire knowledge of truth.

Four elementary rules of reason are:[1]

1. Articulate and seek to improve the articulation of the basic problems to be
   solved.

2. Propose and critically assess alternative possible solutions.

3. When necessary, breaks up the basic problems to be solved into a number of
   specialized problems - preliminary, simpler, analogs, subordinate problems,
   in an attempt to work gradually toward a solution to the basic problems to be
   solved.

4. Inter-connect attempts to solve the basic problem and specialized problems,
   so that basic problem solving may guide, and be guided by, specialized
   problem solving.

No enterprise that violates 1 and 4 can be judged rational.[1]

Granted academic inquiry has as its fundamental aim to help promote human
welfare by intellectual and educational means, then the problems that inquiry
fundamentally ought to try to help solve are problems of living, problems of
action.[1]

Knowledge is only useful insofar as it enables us to act.[1] Failing to act with
knowledge is not meaningful.

Academic inquiry should focus on conflict resolution via cooperative rather than
competitive means.[1]

Knowledge inquiry, because of its irrationality, is designed to intensify, not
help solve, our current global problems.[1]

To Socrates and philosophy was literally the loved of Wisdom.


Ignorance
================================================================================

Ignorance (or folly) is "the having a false opinion and being deceived about
important manners." [1]_ Ignorance is the opposite of wisdom.
