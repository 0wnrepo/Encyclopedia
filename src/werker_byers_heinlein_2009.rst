:Abstract:
    How do infants learn new words?

    To guide their word learning, infants exploit systematic word-learning
    heuristics that allow them to link new words to likely referents.

    By 17 months, infants show `disambiguation`_. Yet, the developmental origins
    of `disambiguation`_ remain unknown. We compared disambiguation in 17- to
    18-month-old infants from different language backgrounds to determine
    whether language experience influences its development, or whether
    disambiguation instead emerges as a result of maturation or social
    experience. Monolinguals showed strong use of disambiguation, bilinguals
    showed marginal use, and trilinguals showed no disambiguation. The number of
    languages being learned, but not vocabulary size, predicted performance. The
    results point to a key role for language experience in the development of
    disambiguation, and help to distinguish among theoretical accounts of its
    emergence.

Introduction
===============================================================================

A hallmark of children's language development in the second year of life is
their emerging ability to rapidly learn new words. One factor that likely
contributes to rapid word learning is children's capacity to infer the meaning
of new words in underspecified contexts. One such process is known as
`disambiguation`_, which is often understood as the product of a `word-learning
constraint`_. Investigation into how `word-learning constraints`_ operate and
where they come from is foundational to understanding the feat of lexical
acquisition.

.. TODO: How does the last statement follow..?

Most of the research to date investigation `disambiguation`_ has focused on
children's underling motivation for mapping the novel noun onto the novel
object. Several accounts posit a socio-pragmatic origin of this heuristic.
Other accounts are conceptual in nature. The question of how `disambiguation`_
first develops has received considerably less attention.

Study 1
===============================================================================

Word learning and `disambiguation`_ do not develop synchronously;
word learning develops as early as 6 months and `disambiguation`_ does not
becomes available until between 16 and 18 months. Why is this so?  Different
accounts of `disambiguation`_ provide various hypotheses.

Multilingual children are of particular theoretical interest, as they must learn
a basic-level label in each of their languages for each object (one in each
language) in apparent contradiction to constraints such as mutual exclusivity.

Several studies show that preschoolers and school-aged children bilinguals
show a weaker tendency to disambiguate novel nouns than monolinguals do.

If `disambiguation`_ differs between monolinguals and multilinguals initially,
then this would provide strong evidence that language experience influences the
development of disambiguation and not just its later use.

:Question:
    Does language experience contribute to the development of `disambiguation`_
    or does `disambiguation`_ emerge as children gained increased social and
    linguistic experience during their preschool years?

:Hypothesis: 

:Prediction:
    Different accounts of `disambiguation`_ and its developmental origins yield
    different predictions about the relative performance of each group.

    - If the development of `disambiguation`_ emerges on a maturational
      timetable, then infants should show similar performance on a
      disambiguation task regardless of language background.

    - If the development of `disambiguation`_ is related to socio-pragmatic
      competence, then there is no particular reasons to predict any differences
      between the group as all would have had a similar amount of social
      experience.

    - If the development of disambiguation is influenced by language experience
      itself, then markedly different types of early experience might change the
      development timetable of disambiguation.

:Experiment:
    48 infants between 17 and 18 old (the age when `disambiguation`_ is first
    shown in monolingual infants), participated, 16 from each monolingual,
    bilingual, and trilingual backgrounds.

    We used a `preferential looking-while-listening` paradigm to test infants.

:Results:
    Monolinguals showed strong use of disambiguation, bilinguals showed marginal
    use, and trilinguals showed no disambiguation.
    
:Conclusion:

:Discussion:
    The number of languages being learned, but not vocabulary size, predicted
    performance. The results point to a key role for language experience in the
    development of disambiguation, and help to distinguish among theoretical
    accounts of its emergence.

.. _disambiguation:

Disambiguation
    The heuristic of mapping a novel word onto a novel object.

    For example, in the presence of a cup and an unfamiliar object such as a
    garlic press, children tend to associate a novel word like 'zav' with the
    garlic press rather than with the cup .

.. _word-learning constraint:
.. _word-learning constraints:

Word-learning constraint
    A bias that allows children to limit the scope of plausible referents that
    they consider for the meaning of a novel word.
