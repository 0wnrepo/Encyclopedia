Through the platform, administrators and clinicians gain deep analytics for business and clinical intelligence, resource utilization, treatment patterns, network management and research.[4]

# History

Flatiron was started by Zach Weinberg and Nat Turner after they left Google in June 2012.

Weinberg and Turner were two of the founders of Invite Media, an advertising technology company acquired by Google for $81M in 2010, after three years in Philadelphia.

Weinberg and Turner are turner are both passionate about healthcare.[2] They have made angel investments while at Google.[4]

Turner is a gold, music enthusiast, and fisherman.[3]

They noticed a particular problem in the oncology problem.[4]

Turner's seven-year-old cousin was diagnosed with Leukemia. The actual determination of what type of cancer was not properly administrated which revealed a big gap in how media data was analyzed.[4]

Analysis of the oncology industry revealed that most cancer care centers were deprived of even the most basic data analysis tools that other industries use daily.

Currently (9/2013) in private beta with a small group of providers and other partners.

## Investors

> Turner says the new funds will be used to expand Flatiron Health’s engineering and product teams. Flatiron Health, which has 12 employees, is in private beta with a select group of providers and other partners in the United States. The startup has signed on five major hospital systems (all on the East Coast and primarily Northeast), including a well-known academic cancer center.[4]

> “Oncology is one of the fastest growing and unique segments of the health care industry, and oncologists and researchers need new and advanced tools to keep up,” said Dr. Krishna Yeshwant of Google Ventures. “Nat and Zach’s passion to address this challenge and reputation for building disruptive software companies were key in our decision to lead the round.
