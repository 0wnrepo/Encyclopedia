================================================================================

A symbol is an intentional arbitrary sign_; a substitute for a concept.

A symbol is a sign whose connection with its object is a matter of convention,
agreement, or rule. [1]

Example: fashion?
Example: black signifies death

In a symbol, there is no connection or resemblance between a sign and object; a
symbol communicate only because people agree that it shall stand for what it
does. [1]

Symbols bear no resemblance to what they represent.

Symbols enable displacement.

Symbols require traditional transmission; users must learn its conventional
meaning.
