Pragmatics
================================================================================

Pragmatics comes from the Greek word "pragma" meaning 'deed'.

Pragmatics is the study of how people use language, especially in discourse.[3]

Pragmatics is the study of meaning in context.

Pragmatics is the study of how to do things with words.

Pragmatics studies how language users are able to overcome apparently ambiguity since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance.

Pragmatics, as a study of utterance meaning or meaning in context, is necessarily concerned with discourse, not with meaning in isolation, i.e. at word or sentence level

Pragmatics is the study of how the context of the utterance, prexisting knowledge, and the inferred intent of the speaker.

To Semantics
------------

Morris (1938):

> Semantics deals with the relation of signs to objects which they may or do denote.
> Pragmatics concerns the relation of signs to their interpreters.

Stalnaker (1972):

> Syntax studies sentences; semantics studies propositions.
> Pragmatics is the study of linguistic acts and the contexts in which they are performed.
> There are two major types of problems to be solved within pragmatics:
> first, to define interesting types of speech acts and speech products;
> second, to characterize the features of the speech context which help determine which proposition is expressed by a given sentence.
> It is a semantic problem to specify the rules for matching up sentences of a natural language with the propositions that they express.
> In most cases, however, the rules will not match sentences directly with propositions, but will match sentences with propositions relative to features of the context in which the sentence is used.
> These contextual features are part of the subject matter of pragmatics. (p. 383)
