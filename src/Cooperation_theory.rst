Cooperation Theory
================================================================================

A cooperation theory places cooperation at the center of `language use`_.[4]

Joint Action Theory
================================================================================

Speakers use indirect speech in the joint striving for equity. If costs and benefits are not balanced for a speaker or hearer, it threatens their face, leads to distress, and sets up a shared goal of redressing the imbalance through compensating action or speech of a reinterpretation of the goods at sake.[4]

    *   Alan offers Barbara some Manzanilla sherry, and she accepts.

        When Alan proposes the offer, he puts his face at risk. What if she takes the sherry without adequate recompense?

        And when Barbra takes up his proposal, she puts her own face at risk. What if she cannot repay him for the favor?[4]

Politeness Theory
================================================================================

@See Brown and Levinson 1987

Politeness theory extends the cooperative principle to the speaker and hearer's cooperation of maintaining 'face'-- the degree of approval and autonomy that a person can claim in social interactions.[Lee/Pinker]

A speaker's request for attention or favors is a threat to the hearer's face.[4] Consequently, speakers soften their requests with several kinds of politeness.

Politeness strategies are arranged on a continuum of face-restoring power:[3]

1. Positive politeness
2. Negative politeness
3. On-record speech act
4. Off-record speech act

### Positive Politeness

Positive politeness is an assurance of sympathy.[3]

    * Compliments
    * Terms of endearment and familiarity

Positive politeness tends to accompany threats to solidarity (e.g. criticizing a friend).[3]

### Negative Politeness

Negative politeness is an acknowledge of deference.[3]

    * Apology
    * Hedges
    * Interrogatives

Negative politeness tends to accompany threats to power (e.g. onerous request)[3]
