:Abstract:
    Between 6 and 12 months of age, the ability of infants to discriminate
    foreign language phonetic units sharply declines, but this decline is
    reversible.

    In this paper, the authors investigate:

    1.  When, how much, and what kind of foreign-language experience is
        necessary to prevent decline in foreign-language speech perception? [1]_
    2.  Does social interaction contribute to `phonetic learning`_? [2]_

    The first study investigated question 1.

    It was concluded that infants exposed to infant-directed speech by 4
    speakers of Mandarin in 12 sessions between 9 and 10 months of age was
    sufficient to reverse the decline seen in the absence of experience for
    foreign-language phonetic contrasts.

    The first study investigated question 2.

    It was concluded that between 9 and 10 months of age, infants show phonetic
    learning from live, but not prerecorded, exposure to a foreign language.

Introduction
============

Infant exposure to their native language:

1. Dramatically alters their perception of speech
2. Reduces sensitivity to foreign language speech

Between 6 and 12 months of age:

-   Infants' ability to discriminate foreign language phonetic units declines
    sharply. 
-   There is a significant increase in native-language speech perception
    performance.

    This indicates that phonetic development involves growth rather than the
    simple maintenance of phonetic abilities.

Infant studies show that by the age of 9 months, the decline in foreign
language phonetic perception is well underway by this time.

Experiment 1
============

:Question:
    When, how much, and what kind of foreign-language experience is
    necessary to prevent decline in foreign-language speech perception? [1]_

    Does first-time foreign language exposure between 9 and 10 months of age
    induce phonetic learning?
:Hypothesis: 
    Foreign language intervention at 9 months of age would alter phonetic
    perception for a phonetic contrast of that language.

    Infants exposed to a foreign language will reverse the decline in phonetic
    perception shown in infants who are exposed only to their native language.
:Prediction:
    Infants exposed to Mandarin will reverse the decline in Mandarin phonetic
    perception shown in the English control group.
:Experiment:
    32 9-month-old healthy American infants of whom English was the only
    language spoken in the household were assigned randomly into two equally
    sized groups.

    Both groups participated in 12 laboratory sessions over 4 weeks.
    
    - Subjects in the exposure group were exposed to Mandarin
    - Subjects in the control group were exposed to English.

    During the sessions, a native speaker of Mandarin or English read from
    children's books and played with toys using prescribed materials. [*]_ [*]_

    After completion of the sessions, the decline was tested by:

    1. Conditioning infants to turn their heads when they heard a change in
       sound.
    2. Playing selected sounds that native speakers of Mandarin would be more
       effective at discriminating than speakers of English.

    .. phonemic contrast
:Results:
    Prediction was confirmed.

    Subsequent tests of Mandarin speech perception demonstrated that exposure
    to Mandarin reversed the decline seen in the English control group.

    Performance on the American English contrast was identical.

    Performance was not affected by the length of time between exposure and
    test.
:Conclusion:
    The results confirmed the hypothesis.

    Infants exposed to infant-directed speech by four speakers of Mandarin in
    12 sessions between 9 and 10 months of age was sufficient to reverse the
    decline seen in the absence of experience for foreign-language phonetic
    contrasts.

    American infants exposed to Mandarin Chinese performed at a level comparable
    to that of infants raised in Taiwan and significantly better than infants
    in the English control group who were not exposed to Mandarin.

    ..  What does "infants raised in Taiwan" mean? Taiwanese? Or speakers of
        English raised in Taiwan?
:Discussion:
    The findings suggest that short-term exposure to a foreign language is
    sufficient to induce learning at 9 months of age.

    .. What does "sufficient to induce learning" mean? I thought it was prevent
       decline.
:Questions:
    -   Is phonetic learning simply triggered by auditory exposure to a natural
        language?

.. [*] Four speakers from each language took turns conducting the sessions so that
       infants were exposed to a variety of speaking styles, which results in
       better phonetic learning in adult listeners mastering a foreign language.

.. [*] Speakers used infant-direct speech ("motherese") because it has been shown
       to be a more effective signal from which to learn phonetic categories
       compared with adult directed speech.

Experiment 2
============

:Question:
    Is phonetic learning simply triggered by auditory exposure to a natural
    language or does social interaction contribute to phonetic learning? [2]_

    Does learning from foreign language exposure between 9 and 10 months of
    age occur in the absence of social interaction?
:Hypothesis:
    `Phonetic learning`_ between 9 and 10 months of age is simply triggered by
    hearing language.
:Prediction:
    Exposure to recorded foreign language material should result in learning.
    Specifically, DVD (audio-visual or audio) should result in learning.
:Subjects:
    32 full-term 9-month-old infants

    Criteria for inputs was identical to `experiment 1`_.
:Experiment:
    Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
    
    1. 16 (eight boys) were exposed to Mandarin via auditory input
    2. 16 (eight boys) were exposed to Mandarin via auditory-visual input

    The same foreign-language material was presented.

    Infants took part in 12 language exposure session over 4 weeks.

    Testing procedure was identical to `experiment 1`_.
:Results:
    Foreign language intervention in the audio-visual and audio conditions
    had no effect on phonetic perception.
:Conclusion:
    Exposure to recorded foreign language, without interpersonal interaction,
    has no effect on the decline of `phonetic learning`_.
:Discussion:
    Infants between 9 and 10 months of age show `phonetic learning`_ from live,
    but not prerecorded, exposure to a foreign language, suggesting a learning
    process that does not require long-term listening and is enhanced by social
    interactions.

General Discussion
==================

The results of `experiment 2`_ are consistent with a variety of studies on
other children exposed to language material, both native and foreign, from
children's TV shows. The results indicate that, although there is evidence that
specific vocabulary items can be learned through exposure to television
programs, the more complex aspects of language, such as phonetics and grammar,
are not acquired from TV exposure.



Appendix

.. _phonetic learning:

Phonetic learning
    Phonetic learning refers to the rapid acquisition of detailed information
    about the regularities of language.

Neural commitment
    The phenomenon of decline in foreign-language perception due to exposure
    to native language.

    Kuhl as argued that the decline infants' foreign-language perception is
    directly related to native-language learning, proposing that exposure to a
    specific language results in "neural commitment" to the acoustic properties
    of that language.

    Neural commitment to the native language interferes with foreign-language
    processing, causing difficulty in foreign-language speech perception in
    infancy and adulthood.

    On this view, infants are better than adults at acquiring a second language
    because the native-language learning process, and thus neural commitment to
    patterns, is incomplete.

Footnotes

.. [1] This assumes the decline in foreign-language speech perception is not
       inevitable but preventable by exposure to a foreign language.
       
       The authors think this is reasonable because young children can acquire
       more than one language.
.. [2] There is evidence in other species, such as songbrids, that learning
       is enhanced by social interaction. In humans, it has been argued social
       interaction is critical for language learning, but few experimental data
       exists oto test the hypothesis.
