Interactive activation model
================================================================================

The **|IAM|** is an influential `neural network`_ model of `word recognition`_,
developed in `Rumelhart McClelland 1981`_. It was designed to account for
context effects in letter and word perception.

The |IAM| makes an important assumption that distinguishes it from bottom-up
models: assumes two-way connections among some of the units as opposed to the
one-way flow of information from input to the pout.

In the |IAM|, there are three layers of units: feature, letters, and words.
