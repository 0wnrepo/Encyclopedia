Dialectic
================================================================================

Dialectic is a method of argument for resolving disagreement; discourse between
two or more people holding different points of view about a subject, who wish to
establish the truth of the matter guided by reasoned arguments. As dialectic
seeks truth, it is distinguished from other forms of discourse in that it avoids
appeals to emotion and ethics.

The word "dialectic" originated in `classical Greece`_ was made popular by
Plato_ in the `Socratic dialogues`_.

Dialectic is the counterpart to rhetoric_. Rhetoric constructs an argument;
dialectic deconstructs an argument. The deconstruction leads to contradiction if
the argument is unsound.

.. todo: Adler talks about this. It seems that today, dialectic is better
.. understood as criticism.
