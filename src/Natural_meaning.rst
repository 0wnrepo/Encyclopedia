Natural Meaning      
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Natural meaning (or an infallible-sign) describes a connection between certain events or states in the world and their natural consequences.

  * "Those spots mean measles" (spots are a unconventional signal for the presence of measles)
  * "The recent budget means that we shall have a hard year."
  * "Storm clouds mean rain."
  * "The rings on the stump mean the tree was old"

Formally, a sign `x` is a natural sign iff `x` means that `p` and `x` meant that `p` truly entails `p`.

Properties:

1. One cannot infer anything about what was meant by a natural sign
2. One cannot mean anything by a natural sign
3. One cannot restate sentences containing natural signs such that the verb "mean" is followed by a sentence or a phrase in inverted commas. (e.g. "Those spot meant 'measles'")
4. One restate sentences containing natural signs so as to begin with "the fact that". (e.g. "That fact that he had those spots meant that he had measles.")
