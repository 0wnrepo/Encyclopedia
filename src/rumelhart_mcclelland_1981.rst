Introduction
================================================================================

:Pages: 37-38 (2)

A central issue in the development of a model of the reading process is *the way
the context in which a linguistic element is found affects the way that element
is processed and ultimately interpreted*.

The authors previously proposed an `interactive model`_, but:

1. It was very general

2. It suffered from a lack of direct connection to an empirical base, and

3. It suffered from a lack of specificity of how the brain might actually out
   such complex computations.
   
Here, the authors attempt to propose a model that addresses these concerns.

Some important facts about word perception
================================================================================

:Pages: 38-43 (6)

Key historical findings:

- |WP|_ is possible in conditions where accurate |LP|_ is not.

- At a given exposure level, |WP|_ is more accurate for common |Ws|.

- |LP|_ is more accurate in |NWs| that look like |Ws| than |NWs| that do not.

These phenomena support the view that |LP|_ in |Ws| and |NWs| is not
independent of context. However, it is possible to interpret them in terms of
`postperceptual guessing` [#]_ or `postperceptual forgetting processes` [#]_.
`Reicher 1969`_ eliminated these nonperceptual interpretations and conclusively
demonstrated that |WC|_ facilitates |LP|_. [#]_

More recently, researchers eliminated the possibility that recognition of
familiar visual forms facilitates |WP|_ over |NWP|_, suggesting that |WP|_
relies on the arrangement of |LS|.

This seems to create a paradox: If |WP|_ relies on the arrangement of |LS|, then
it seems to follow that |WP|_ relies on the results of |LP|_. But if |WC|_
facilitates |LP|_ as in `Reicher 1969`_, then it seems to follow that |LP|_
relies on the results of |WP|_. The paradox can be resolved if we consider that
|LP|_ may be incomplete when interacting with |WK|.

Perhaps what |WK| does is allows us to

.. [#]
    Word perception might be better than nonword perception simply because
    subjects could guess imperfectly perceived words based on their knowledge of
    English.

.. [#]
    |WP| might be better than |NWP| simply because a large number of unrelated
    |Ls| might pose a memory load that would limit accuracy of identification,
    even if all the |Ls| were perceived accurately

.. [#]
    Postperceptual guessing can be eliminated because |LP| was more
    accurate in words despite the fact that both alternatives would have formed
    a word.

    Postperceptual forgetting can be eliminated because |LP| was more accurate
    in words than with single |Ls|.

.. _interactive model:

Interactive model
    A model in which data-driven, bottom-up processing combines with
    conceptually-driven, top-down, processing to cooperatively determine the
    most likely interpretation of the input, proposed by Rumelhart (1977) to
    explicate the role of context during reading.

    Roughly speaking processing in an interactive model proceeds in the
    following way:

    1. The reader begins with a set of expectations about what information is
       likely to be available through visual input.
    2. These expectations, or initial hypotheses, are based on our knowledge of
       the structure of letters, words, phrases, sentences, and larger pieces of
       discourse, including nonlinguistic aspects of the current contextual
       situation.
    3. As visual information from the page begins to become available, it
       strengthens those hypotheses that are consistent with the input and
       weakens those that are inconsistent.
    4. The stronger hypotheses, in turn, make even more specific predications
       about the information available in the visual input.
    5. To the degree that these hypotheses are confirmed, they are further
       strengthened, and the processing is faciliated.
