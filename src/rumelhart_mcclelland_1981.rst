Introduction
================================================================================

:Pages: 37-38 (2)

A central issue in the development of a model of the reading process is *the way
the context in which a linguistic element is found affects the way that element
is processed and ultimately interpreted*.

The authors previously proposed an `interactive model`_, but:

1. It was very general

2. It suffered from a lack of  direct connection to an empirical base, and

3. It suffered from a lack of specificity of how the brain might actually out
   such complex computations.
   
Here, the authors attempt to propose a model that addresses these concerns.

Some important facts about word perception
================================================================================

:Pages: 38-43 (6)

Key historical findings:

- Word perception is possible in conditions where accurate letter perception is
  not.

- At a given exposure level, word perception is more accurate for common words.

- Letter perception is more accurate in nonwords that look like words than
  nonwords that do not.

These phenomena support the view that letter perception in words and nonwords
is not independent of context. However, it is possible to interpret them in
terms of `postperceptual guessing` [#]_ or `postperceptual forgetting processes`
[#]_. `Reicher 1969`_ eliminate these nonperceptual interpretations and
conclusively demonstrated that word context facilitates letter perception. [#]_

More recently, `McClelland 1976` and `Adams 1979` eliminated the possibility
that recognition of familiar shapes facilitates word perception over nonword
perception, suggesting that knowledge of the arrangement of letters rather
than their exact visual form facilitates word perception.

This seems to create a paradox: If `word perception` relies on the arrangement
of letters in words, then it seems to follow that `word perception` relies on
the results of `letter perception`, but `Reicher 1969`_ showed that `word
context` facilitates `letter perception`. The paradox can be resolved if we
consider that `letter perception` may be incomplete when interacting with `word
knowledge`.

Footnotes

.. [#]
    Word perception might be better than nonword perception simply because
    subjects could guess imperfectly perceived words based on their knowledge of
    English.

.. [#]
    Word perception might be better than nonword perception simply because a
    large number of unrelated letters might pose a memory load that would limit
    accuracy of identification, even if all the letters were perceived
    accurately

.. [#]
    Postperceptual guessing can be eliminated because letter perception was more
    accurate in words despite the fact that both alternatives would have formed
    a word.

    Postperceptual forgetting can be eliminated because letter perception was
    more accurate in words than with single letters.

Glossary

.. _interactive model:

Interactive model
    A model in which data-driven, bottom-up processing combines with
    conceptually-driven, top-down, processing to cooperatively determine the
    most likely interpretation of the input, proposed by Rumelhart (1977) to
    explicate the role of context during reading.

    Roughly speaking processing in an interactive model proceeds in the
    following way:

    1. The reader begins with a set of expectations about what information is
       likely to be available through visual input.
    2. These expectations, or initial hypotheses, are based on our knowledge of
       the structure of letters, words, phrases, sentences, and larger pieces of
       discourse, including nonlinguistic aspects of the current contextual
       situation.
    3. As visual information from the page begins to become available, it
       strengthens those hypotheses that are consistent with the input and
       weakens those that are inconsistent.
    4. The stronger hypotheses, in turn, make even more specific predications
       about the information available in the visual input.
    5. To the degree that these hypotheses are confirmed, they are further
       strengthened, and the processing is faciliated.

.. _interactive processing:

Interactive processing
    A form of cooperative processing in which all knowledge at all levels of
    abstraction can come into play in the process of reading and comprehension.
