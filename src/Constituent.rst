Constituent
================================================================================

A constituent is a group of words_ that function together as a unit.

Constituents are not the same as the syntactic category labels, but refer to the
words themselves.

The constituent structure of sentences is identified using constituency tests.

Many constituents are phrases_. For example noun phrases.

Constituents are embedded in one another to form larger constituents.

Representation
================================================================================

Syntacticians represent constituents in two ways:

1. Square brackets around units. For example, ``[the students]``.
   
2. Tree structure

Constituency tests
================================================================================

In this chapter, we have proposed the hypotheses that sentences are composed of
higher level groupings called constituents. Constituents are represented in tree
structures and are generated by rules. If the hypothesis of constituency is
correct, we should be able to test it in general as well as test the specific
instances of the rules.

In order to figure out what kinds of tests we need, it is helpful to reconsider
the specifics of the hypothesis.

Tests for constituency are instances where groups of words behave as single
units. There are many constituency tests listed in the syntactic literature. We
are going to look at only four here:

Substitution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Substitution (or replacement) is ...

- Pronoun substitution

    - There substitution

- Do-so substitution

Substitution refers to the process of targeting a string of words and
substituting another word for (for instance, a pronoun).

    Alice saw [the boy in calculus class].

    Alice saw [him].

Do-so substitution:

    The plastics will wear pink on Wed.

    The plastics will do so.

Always consumes arguments and sometimes adjuncts (non-arguments).

Do-so can tell whether a determiner phrase that follows an verb is an argument
or an adjunct.
