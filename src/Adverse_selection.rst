Adverse selection
================================================================================

Adverse selection is name for the phenomenon of bad goods driving out the good.

Adverse selection reduces the efficiency of trade and in some circumstances, it
can cause a market to collapse entirely.

History
================================================================================

It was first described in 1970 by George Akerlof in his paper, [The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism][8]:

Conditions for existence
================================================================================

Adverse selection occurs in markets where:

1. Buyers cannot directly observe the quality of goods.

2. The interests of buyers and sellers do not align (sellers have an incentive to be dishonest).

    There are many markets in which buyers use some market statistic to judge the quality of prospective purchases. In this case, there is incentive for sellers to market poor quality merchandise, since the returns for good quality accrue mainly to the entire group whose statistic is affected rather than the individual seller. As a result there has tends to be a reduction in the average equality of goods and also in the size of the market... The purchaser's problem, of course, is to identify quality.

- In ideal markets, buyers and sellers could appraise the quality of products
  perfectly and sales would occur only when both could expect to capture value.

- In real markets, appraising quality is difficult. In many cases, traders who
  have more information than others are better able to decide when to buy and
  sell, which enables them to capture value. In certain cases, the difficult of
  appraisal encourages dishonesty in markets, which can cause a general
  degradation of the quality of goods. Markets suffering from such a phenomenon
  are said to be suffering from adverse selection.

- Since buyers cannot appraise goods, rational behavior requires them to
  estimate the quality as the market average.

- Since sellers can appraise goods and would not rationally accept less than
  what they think their goods are worth, sellers will remove goods that are
  greater than the average market quality from the market.

- Consequently, buyers will reduce their prices to reflect the new (lesser)
  average quality, beginning a cycle.

Stated slightly more formally:

- Let `max_buy_price(q)` be the reservation price buyers are willing to pay for
  a car of quality `q`.

- Let `min_sell_price(q)` be the reservation price sellers are willing to sell
  for a car of quality `q`.

- If quality is observable, then the price, `price` of a used car of quality `q`
  should be between the buyer's and seller's reservation prices,
  `max_buy_price(q) >= p >= min_sell_price(q)`.

- If quality is unobservable then buyers will use the average quality of car on
  the market to set the equilibrium price and sellers will remove their cars
  from the market if their reservation price exceeds the equilibrium price, such
  that `equilibrium_price = max_buy_price(q_avg(equilibrium_price, q_min))`.

- Then if `equilibrium_price > max_buy_price(q_avg(equilibrium_price, q_min))`
  the market will collapse.

In particular, markets do not collapse (although they may be inefficient) so
long as:

- Confidence in the average quality of goods on the market is relatively high

- Buyer reservation prices are relatively high

- Minimum quality is relatively high

Of further note:

- Buyers can improve the average quality of their purchases by filtering to
  raise the minimum quality they can get. The maximum quality they can get is
  determined by their price. Appraisal must therefore be designed to determine
  the minimum value.

- Assessing maximum value is only valuable as a tool to reduce reservation
  value, and is only useful once minimum value has been deemed high enough to
  make risk limits acceptable.

Nearly all markets suffer from adverse selection to some degree. Accurate
appraisal takes expertise and is frequently impossible. Especially prominent
examples include insurance markets (buyers know more about their risk than
sellers), used car markets, sexual markets, restaurant markets, and of course
job markets. Adverse selection is easily identified where one can identify risk
by trying something new.

In markets where high quality goods are scarce, adverse selection is further
exacerbated by the fact that expert buyers reduce the average quality of good on
the market. As a corollary, the propensity of a good to be on the market is
inversely correlated with its market value.

Adverse selection can be further exacerbated when the value of quality goods is
not proportional to the cost paid. For instance, bad employees not only must be
fired, but they may slow down fellow team members and damage team morale.

Talent must be certified by a credible certifying establishment before a company
can afford to use them.

Lack of credibility can create some issues for people with talent who cannot
afford to increase trust.

The reward for work in incredible establishments tends to accrue to the group as
a whole raising its average quality rather than to the individual.
