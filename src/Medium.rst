Medium
================================================================================

A medium is a technical or physical mean of converting a message_ into a signal
capable of being transmitted along a channel_.[9]

  * voice
  * broadcasting
  * dress

A medium may use many channels_.

* television (uses channel of vision and sound)

The technical constraints of a medium define the range of possible codes.

* Medium-specific codes used in the visual channel for a TV program: lighting, color, speed, definition, framing, camera movement, placing, editing

The cultural constraints of a medium define the use of codes.

Kinds
================================================================================

Media are divided into three main categories:[9]

1. `Presentational medium`_
2. `Representational medium`_
3. `Mechanical medium`_

Presentational medium
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A presentational medium uses the 'natural' languages of spoken words, expressions, gestures, etc.

  * the voice
  * the face
  * the body

Presentational media require the presence of the communicator, for he or she is the medium, and consequently restricted to the here now.

Presentational media produce acts of communication.

Representational medium
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A representational medium uses cultural and aesthetic convention.

  * books
  * paintings
  * photographs
  * writing
  * architecture
  * interior decorating
  * gardening

Representational media can exist independent of the communicator.

Representational media produce works of communication (text) that record the media of presentational media.

Mechanical medium
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A mechanical medium transmits presentational and representational media.

  * telephone
  * radio
  * television
  * telexes

Mechanical media use channels created by engineering.

Mechanical media are subject to greater technological constraints.

Mechanical media are more affected by level-A noise than representational media.
