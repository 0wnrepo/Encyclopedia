Grammatical case
================================================================================

Grammatical case is a `grammatical category`_ whose value reflects the
`grammatical function`_ performed by a noun or pronoun in a phrase_, clause_, or
sentence_.

English has largely lost its case system, although case distinctions can still
be seen with the personal pronouns: form such as I, he and we are used in the
role of the subject, while forms such as me, him, and us are used in the role of
object.

Languages such as Ancient Greek and Latin have extensive case systems.
