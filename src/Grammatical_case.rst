Grammatical case
================================================================================

Grammatical case is a `grammatical category`_ whose value reflects the
`grammatical function`_ performed by a noun or pronoun in a phrase_, clause_, or
sentence_.

English has largely lost its case system, although case distinctions can still
be seen with the personal pronouns: form such as *I*, *he* and *we* are used in
the role of the subject, while forms such as *me*, *him*, and *us* are used in
the role of object.

Languages such as Ancient Greek and Latin have extensive case systems.

Nominative refers to the case form the pronouns take when in the subject
position.

Accusative refers to the form they take when in object positions.
