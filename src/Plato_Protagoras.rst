Summary
================================================================================

`Protagoras` begins with Socrates and a companion covering. Socrates's companion
asks Socrates where he has been, teasing him about having chasing Alcibiades.
Socrates explains that he has just gotten back from talking with Protagoras.
Socrates's companion asks Socrates to explain the story.

Socrates begins by explaining that he learned of Protagoras arrival in `Athens
<Classical Athens_>`_ when a young man named Hippocrates_ knocked at his house
very early in the morning. Hippocrates is evidently excited.

Socrates and Hippocrates decide to walk over `the court` and wait until daybreak
before visiting Protagoras at House of Callias. Socrates questions Hippocrates
about his desire to study with Protagoras. He asks Hippocrates what he expects
to learn from Protagoras; surely, from one learns from any artist their art, but
what art does Protagoras teach? Hippocrates replies that Protagoras is a
Sophist, and that he expects to learn to become a Sophist. Socrates asks
Hippocrates if he is ashamed of the thought of becoming a Sophist, which
Hippocrates admits. [*]_ Socrates confirms that the teachings of Protagoras do
not make one a skilled artist, but are only a part of education (like grammar,
music, or physical health). More specifically, Hippocrates explains that
Protagoras teachs the art of "mak[ing] men eloquent", but Socrates presses
Hippocrates on what matter, given that artists should make anyone talk
eloquently about their art. Hippocrates admits he doesn't know.

Socrates warns Hippocrates that his decision to study with Protagoras is
impulsive and dangerous. Socrates warns that knowledge is "the food of soul",
and, like with food of the body, we must take care when seller praises what he
sells, since, with few exceptions, neither the seller nor the buyer may know
what is good or what is bad. Therefore, if someone has an understanding of what
is good and evil, one can safely buy knowledge, but otherwise then it is more
risky than buying food, since at least with those, one can inspect them again
before consuming.

Protagoras & What is sophistry?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socrates and Hippocrates travel to the house of Callias, where Protagoras is at
(along with `Hippias of Elis`, `Prodicus of Ceos`, and several other wise men).
When they enter, they find Protagoras taking a walk in the cloister followed by
Callias, several other men that Socrates recognizes, though "the greater part of
them appeared to be foreigners, whom Protagoras had brought with him out of the
various cities visited by him in his journeys, he, like Orpheus_, attracting
them his voice, and they following." Nearby, Socrates spots Hippias teaching
physics and astronomy to men who are seated on benches and Prodicus teaching
from bed.

After looking around, Socrates and Hippocrates walk up to Protagoras and
Socrates explains that they are there because Hippocrates "aspires to political
eminence" and think that speaking with Protagoras would be most helpful. They
ask Protagoras whether he would like to speak in private or in public, to which
Protagoras replies with a long speech, dispelling the hatred against sophists
and stating his pride of openly being one, before answering that he would like
to speak in public. [1]_ Socrates and Callias suggest that the two hold a public
discussion, to which everyone agrees, and everyone assembles where Hippias had
been teaching earlier to listen.

Socrates restates his purpose of visiting, and explain that Hippocrates would
like to know "what will happen if he associates with you". Protagoras replies
that Hippocrates will be better everyday he stays with him, to which Socrates
essentially asks "better in what way?". Protagoras replies that he will learn
"prudence in affairs private as well as public; he will learn to order his own
house in the best manner, and he will be able to speak and act for the best in
the affairs of the state." Socrates restates it, with the approval of
Protagoras, as "the art of politics, and [the] promise to make men good
citizens."

*Note: I am going to the political art or skill as "virtue".*

Can virtue be taught?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socrates objects to the claim that virtue can be taught for two reasons:

   :depth: 1

Why do the Athenians permit anyone to engage in politics?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Socrates explains that the Athenians only let experts speak when a matter is one
that one can be an expert in; everyone else is forbidden. However, when a matter
is political in nature, everyone is permitted to speak. It seems then that
Athenians are under the impression that the art cannot be taught.

Protagoras replies with a myth. He explains that Prometheus and Epimetheus were
responsible for creating mortal creatures and by a certain date. In doing so,
they distributed to each defensive abilities, but neglected to give any to man.
As time ran out, Prometheus stole the mechanical arts (and fire with them) and
gave them to man. However, man did not have political wisdom, and though men
gathered in cities to avoid being destroyed by beasts, they destroyed each
other. Zeus, seeing this, granted them justice and reverence.

Further, if a man say that he is skillful in art in which he has no skill,
people think that he is mad. But equally when a man denies he has virtue which
he must have, people think he is mad. Thus the Athenians admit every man as a
counselor of virtue as they are of the opinion that every man partakes in it.

Further still, Protagoras argues that the men do not conceive political virtue
to be given by nature, but to be a thing which may be taught, since if they did
not, then they would not punish men, since they punish men only if they believe
the defendant was ignorant of a virtue which can be taught, assuming that
certain virtues can be taught, and that punishment teaches them. (By corollary,
if a man cannot be taught, then he is removed from society.)

Why can good men teach their sons skilled art, but not political art?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Protagoras replies to this with an argument. He begins by pointing out that if
virtue is teachable, it surely would be hard to be believe that wise men did not
teach their sons virtue, teaching them mechanical arts instead, especially given
that failing to learn virtue is punishable by death. But, Protagoras argues,
wise men *do* teach their sons virtue, and they do so beginning from when a
child understands what is being said to him to the very end of his life. First
they do so as parents, pointing out right and wrong and correcting by
punishment, then by sending the child to teachers who teach him etiquette, then
by giving him books of great poets, and songs, and then by sending to the master
of gymnastic. And after the student is done with school, the state compels him
to learn the laws, which serve as an example of a moral life.

Protagoras then answers why the sons of good father often turn out ill. He
explains that to some degree, one's skill in virtue is due to natural
capacities; thus, the son of a good citizen might be a bad citizen and vice
versa.

Protagoras also makes the point that even the list virtuous of civil men is more
than virtuous than uncivilized man.

Protagoras explain that all men are teachers of virtue, each one according to
his ability, in the same way that all men are teacher of language. As such, it
is hard to find teachers of virtue, since most men are already well-educated.
Protagoras claims then, that as a teacher of virtue, he is only slightly better
than his peers, but they must be content with the result. (He explains then that
his pupils only pay what they think he is worth.)

One small difficulty
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Protagoras finishes his argument, Socrates explains he was quite charmed.
He praises Protagoras for his conduct in conversation and ability to both give
long speeches and answer briefly.

Then Socrates explains that he has one small difficulty: Is virtue one whole, of
which justice and temperance and holiness are parts, or are they only the names
of one and the same thing? At this Socrates begins a cross-examination.

Protagoras explains that they are unique parts, related to each other as the
parts of a face are related to the whole face, and separate, so that a man can
one but not the other. Furthermore, each has a distinct function. Socrates goes
on to show that justice and holiness are nearly identical, and then does the
same with wisdom and temperance (by showing both to be the opposite of folly,
and getting Protagoras to agree everything has only one opposite). Protagoras
"assent, but with great reluctance". Socrates concludes that temperance and
wisdom are the same, as before justice and holiness appear to be the same.

Socrates threatens to leave
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socrates then continues down a line asking about what "good" is, to which
Protagoras replies with a speech, answering that the good is expedient for man,
but not all things expedient for man are good, and some things that are not good
for man are good for other animals and vice-versa.

After Protagoras's speech, Socrates, realizing that Protagoras oration's are
making discussion impossible, claims he has poor memory and asks Protagoras to
cut his answers short. Protagoras resists, and Socrates pins him on his
reputation of being able to both speak at length or with speak with brevity.
Protagoras resists, claiming that "if I had followed the method of disputation
which my adversaries desired, as you want me to do, I should have been no better
than another, and the name of Protagoras would have been nowhere." Socrates
restates his admission that he is unable to follow long speeches, and point out
that as Protagoras is being uncooperative, he should leave and get going to
another engagement. Callias stops him, begging him to say, to which Socrates
replies that he simply cannot compete. Callias replies that each man may speak
his own way, to which Alcibiades replies that that is false.

Hippias proposes that Socrates choose an umpire for the discussion, but Socrates
objects that no suitable umpire could be chosen. Socrates proposes instead that
if Protagoras will not answer, then Protagoras should be allowed to ask as many
questions as he likes to Socrates, and afterward Socrates should be allowed to
ask as many question as he likes to Protagoras, to which everyone agrees.

The Poetry of Simonides
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO

Interlude
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socrates grants that Protagoras may ask as he is inclined, but suggests no
longer discussion poems and returning to Socrates' original question, stating
that discussing poetry is vulgar, and that educated men amuse each with
orderly conversation. Protagoras tries to avoid answering, but decides to argue
after Alcibiades points out that Protagoras is refusing to answer.

Socrates remind Protagoras that he seeks truth, since Protagoras is wiser than
him.

The nature of virtue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socrates returns to the original question: "Are wisdom and temperance and courage
and justice and holiness five names of the same thing? Or has each of the names
a separate underlying essence and corresponding thing have a peculiar function,
no one of them being like any other of them?" Socrates reminds us that
Protagoras answered they were separate and distinct parts of virtue. Socrates
asks if Protagoras still holds that position, conceding that Protagoras may have
said what he did only in order to make a trail of Socrates.

Protagoras replies that "all these qualities are parts of virtue, and that four
of the five are to some extent similar, and that the fifth of them, which is
courage, is very different from the other four." Protagoras proves this by
claiming that a man can be ignorant, impious, intemperate, and unjust, and yet
still be courageous.

Socrates attempts to refute Protagoras on the by demonstrating courage is
wisdom, by showing that courage requires confidence, and confidence can be
taught, but Protagoras refutes Socrates argument by arguing that courage, unlike
confidence, is unteachable.

Socrates tries again by proving that one cannot be courageous and ignorant. He
begins by establishing that no man voluntarily pursues or accepts that which he
thinks to be evil, and that when man chooses evil, it due to ignorance (of
measuring pleasures and pains). Socrates then gets Protagoras to accept that
going to battle is honorable and good, and by the previous argument, no man
would choose not to go battle except through ignorance, hence, courage requires
wisdom.

Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socrates reminds that his purpose was to ascertain the nature and relation of
virtue, since the answer to whether virtue can be taught would also become
clear. Socrates explains that conclusion of the discussion is remarkable, for
Socrates began by saying that virtue cannot be taught and now attempts to prove
all things are knowledge, and Protagoras began by saying virtue can be taught,
attempts to prove it be anything rather than knowledge, and hence incapable of
being taught. Protagoras applauds Socrates, and they part ways.

Themes
================================================================================

Opposition of Protagoras and Socrates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Characters
================================================================================



Hippocrates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hippocrates is the son of Apollodorus and the brother of Phason, is "of a great
and prosperous house", and "is himself in natural ability quite a match for
anybody of his own age." Socrates believes that "he aspires to political
eminence."

Protagoras
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protagoras is very old, which we learn when says, "And I have been now many years
in the profession -- for all my years when added up are many: there is no here
present of whom I might not be the father" (14).

Questions
================================================================================

At one point, Protagoras says:

    For certainly a stranger finding his way into great cities, and persuading
    the flower or the youth in them to leave company of their kinsmen or any
    other acquaintances, old or young, and live with him, under the idea that
    they will be improved by his conversation, ought to be very cautious...

Am I to understand that it was common for youths to follow people around to
learn an art? (Or perhaps, it is simply the nature of Protagoras's work as a
sophist-- perhaps other artists are more stable.)

.. [*] It's unclear to me why Sophistry is shameful.

.. [*]
    A company like this of ours, and men such as we profess to be, do not
    require the help of another's voice, or of the poets whom you cannot
    interrogate about the meaning of what they are saying... and the point which
    is in dispute can never be decided. This sort of entertainment they decline,
    and prefer to talk with one another, and put one another to the proof in
    conversation.

.. [1] 
    Protagoras dispels the hatred by explaining that a man like himself who
    travels from city to city claiming that they will be improved by
    conversation arouses jealously, and that sophistry is an ancient art, but
    that due to its bad reputation, practitioners disguised themselves under
    other names, such as poets, prophets, gymnastic masters, and musicians.


----

Fear is the expectation of evil. A man will not pursue what he fears when is not
compelled.

Socrates now attacks Protagoras's statement that of the five virtues were nearly
akin, but the that the fifth, courage, differently greatly from the others.
Protagoras proved this by stating some of the most unvirtuous men are among the
courageous. And the brave mean the confident.

The courageous are not ready to go against the same dangers as the cowards; The
cowards go where there is safety, and the courageous where there is danger. The
courages are ready to go against dangers believing them not to be dangers. No
one goes to meet what he thinks to be dangers, since the want of self-control,
which makes men rush into dangers, has been shown to be ignorance. Any yet the
courageous man the coward alike go to meet that about which they are confident;
so that in this point of view the cowardly and the courageous go to meet the
same things.

Going to battle is honorable. And honorable has already been admitted to be
good. Cowards are unwilling to go go to battle. What is good and honorable is
also pleasant.  The cowards do not knowingly refuse to go the pleasanter. The
courageous man goes to meet the pleasanter. And the courageous man has no base
fear or base confidence; and since not base, honorable, and since honorable,
good. The fear and confidence of the coward are base. Base fears confidences
originate in ignorance. Cowards act with a motive of of cowardice. Cowards are
such through their ignorance of dangers. And because of that ignorance they are
coward. Then, the ignorance of what is and is not is cowardice. Courage is the
opposite of cowardice. Then the wisdom which knows what are and are not dangers
is opposed to the ignorance of them.
