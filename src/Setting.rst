### Personal setting

A setting is personal if it is characterized by the free exchange of turns among two or more participants.[4]

  * A converses face to face with B
  * A writes a letter to B

<a name="nonpersonal-setting"></a>
### Nonpersonal setting

A setting is nonpersonal if one agent speaks with little or no opportunity for the interruption or turns by his audience.[4]

  * A professor lectures to student in a class
  * A newspaper reporter writes a news story for readers of the New York Times
  * An essay writes on Scottish castles for readers of Country Life
  * A physicist writes a textbook on electricity and magnetism for university undergraduates
  * A car owner writes to the service department of Ford Motor Company

Nonpersonal settings typically include messages directed at a type of individual (rather than any particular individual known to the sender).[4]

### Institutional setting

A setting is institutional if the participants engage in speech exchanges that resemble ordinary conversation but are limited by institutional rules.

  * A politician holding a news conference
  * A lawyer interrogating a witness in court
  * A mayor chairing a city council meeting
  * A professor directing a seminar discussion
  * A manager writes business correspondence to client
  * An advertising firm composes an advertisement for a magazine
  * A drug company composes the warning label for an aspirin bottle
  * A food company labels a package as baking soda
  * The US Senate legislates the wording of a new tax law
  * The California legislature decides on the wording of state road signs

In some written settings, the words are selected through an institutional procedure.[4] Although one person may have composed the word, it is the institution that is ultimately responsible, approving the wording as faithful to the institution's collective intentions.[4]

### Prescriptive setting

A prescriptive setting is an institutional setting whose spoken words are completely, or largely, fixed beforehand.[4]

  * A member of a church reciting response readings from a prayer book
  * A bride and groom reciting vows in a marriage ceremony
  * A basketball referee calling foul

### Fictional setting

A setting is fictional if the intentions expressed by the speaker are not his own.

  * An actor playing Hamlet
  * A singer singing a love song
  * A television pitchman making a sales pitch to a television audience
  * A novelist writes a novel for his readership

### Mediated setting

A setting is mediated if there are intermediaries between the person whose intentions are being expressed and the target of those intentions.[4]

  * I dictate a letter for Ed to my secretary Annie
  * A telephone company recording tells me of the time or weather
  * A television news reader reads the evening new
  * A lawyer reads Baker's last will and testament at a hearing
  * A recording is triggered in a building announcing a fire and describing how to find the fire escape
  * A UN interpreter translates a diplomat's French simultaneously into English

Written settings can introduce intermediaries between the person whose intentions are being expressed and the intended audience. These again are mediating settings.[4]

Usually, the person actually writing the words is doing so in place of the person who appears to be doing the writing or speaking.[4]

  * The Brothers Grimm write down the folktale "Aschenputtel"
  * A translator translates _Hamlet_ intro French
  * A ghost writer writes Charlie Chaplin's autobiography
  * A speech writer writes a speech for the President
  * My secretary types the letter to Ed from my dictation
  * The manuscript editor for this book edits my writing

A setting is private if an agent speaks for himself without actually addressing anyone else.

  * A man exclaims silently to himself
  * A student talks to himself about solving a mathematic problem
  * A professor rehearses what he am about to say in a seminar
  * A motorist curses at another driver who cannot hear him
  * A man writes in his diary
  * A man scribbles a reminder to myself
  * A student takes notes on a lecture
  * A man makes a grocery list
  * A student works out a mathematics proof on paper
