The activity of reading
#################################################################################

.. This abstract was taken from page 166

:Abstract:
    This part is about the nature of reading in general, the various kinds of
    reading, and the relation of the art of reading ot the art of being taught
    in school and out. It considers, therefore, the serious consequences of the
    neglect of reading in contemporary education, suggesting as a solution that
    books can be substituted for living teachers if individuals can help
    themselves learn how to read.

.. 175

Adler analyzes this part as such:

    The book is divided into three major parts.

    1. The first treats of the nature and kinds of reading, and the place of
       reading in education.

       This part is divided into the following sections.

       1. The varieties and degrees of reading ability.
       2. The major distinctions between reading for amusement and reading for
          instruction.
       3. The distinction, in reading for instruction, between information and
          understanding.
       4. The relation of this last distinction to one between active and
          passive reading.
       5. Defines the sort of reading to be discussed as the reception of
          communications conveying knowledge.
       6. Relates reading to learning, by distinguishing between learning by
          discovery and learning by instruction.
       7. The relation of books and teachers, distinguishing them as dead and
          alive, and shows that reading is learning from dead teachers.
       8. Distinguishes between primary and secondary teachers, living or dead,
          and defines the great books as original communications, and hence
          primary teachers.

    2. The second treats of the failure of contemporary education with respect
       to reading.

       This part is divided into the following sections.

       1. The varieties and degrees of reading ability.
       2. The relation of reading to such other skills as writing and speaking
          are discussed with respect to current educational defects.
       3. The results of scientific educational measurements are reported to
          show the lack of these skills in the graduates of our schools.
       4. Other evidences, especially from book publishers, are offered as
          correlating evidence to these findings.
       5. An attempt is made to explain why the schools have failed.

    3. The third attempts to show how the contemporary education situation can
       be remedied.

       1. Any art of skill can be acquired by those who will practice according
          to the rules.
       2. It is indicated how the art of reading might be acquired by those who
          did not learn how in school.
       3. It is suggested that by learning how to read, people can compensate
          for the defects of their education.
       4. It is hoped that if people generally understood what an education
          should be, through having learned to read and having read, they would
          take serious steps to reform the failing school system.

This is a book for readers who cannot read.

There are many kinds of reading and degrees of ability to read.

This book is for readers who want to read better or want to read in some other
way than they now can.

This book is for people who cannot read at all (e.g. infants, imbeciles) and
masters. 

    Most of us know that we are are not expert reader. We know this in many
    ways, but most obviously when we find some things too difficult to read, or
    have great trouble in reading them; or when someone else has read the same
    thing we have and shown us how much we missed or misunderstood...  Most of
    us have experienced difficulties in reading, but we do not know why we have
    trouble or what to do about it.

    I think this is because most of us do not regard reading as a complicated
    activity, involving many different steps in each of which we can acquire
    more and more skill through practice, as in the case of any other art. We
    may not even think there is an art of reading. We tend to think of reading
    almost as if it were something as simple and natural to do as looking or
    walking. There is no art of looking or walking. 


    I told him that this book was like a book on how to play tennis.

    As written about in books, the art of tennis consists of rules for making
    each of the various strokes, a discussion of how and when to use them, and a
    description of how to organize these parts into the general strategy of a
    successful game. The art of reading has to be written about in the same way.
    There are rules for each of the different steps you must take to complete
    the reading of a whole book.

Knowing how to read well was like any other art or skill.

    For every illusion that the classroom can nourish, there is a school  of
    hard knocks to destroy it.

    Here I wish only to record this fact about our schools, a fact which
    concerns us all, because in large part they have made us what we are
    todaypeople who cannot read well enough to enjoy reading for profit or
    profit by reading for enjoyment. (11)

    But education does not stop with schooling, nor does the responsibility for
    the ultimate educational fate of each of us rest entirely on the school
    system. Everyone can and must decide for himself whether he is satisfied
    with the education he got, or is now getting if he is still in school. If he
    is not satisfied, it is up to him to do something about it. With schools as
    they are, more schooling is hardly the remedy. One way outperhaps the only
    one available to most peopleis to learn to read better, and then, by
    reading better, to learn more of what can be learned through reading. (11)

********************************************************************************
The reading of "reading"
********************************************************************************
:Pages: 16-33

:Abstract: In this chapter we define what we mean by "reading".

We simplify our discussion by limiting our use of "reading" to that which
requires mental activity and that interprets human language.


Degrees of reading
================================================================================

Here we distinguish what it means to read "better" or "worse": [7]_ 

1. In many fields we measure a man's skill by the difficult of the task he can
   perform. Thus, we can say that one man is a better reader than another if he
   can read more *difficult material*. [8]_
   
2. Given the same thing to read, one man reads it better than another insofar as
   he reads it more actively and performs each of the acts involved more
   successfully.

3. One reader is better than another in proportion as he is capable of a greater
   range of activity in reading. This includes both being able to read great
   books and being able to read books by unskilled authors who may inadvertently
   hamper the reader.

Kinds of reading
================================================================================

We can use the word "reading" in two distinct senses since for each individual
there exists two sorts of reading: [11]_

1. Reading anything which immediately comprehensible to us.

2. Reading anything which is challenging to understand.

The first kind makes up the majority of popular reading and is the only kind
lesser readers can do. We do this kind for information or for entertainment
(e.g. newspapers, magazines).   
   
The second kind is a more active kind of reading, entailing not only more varied
activity, but more skill in the performance of the various acts required. There
are two conditions under which this kind of reading takes place:

1. Initially, the writer understands more than the reader, and is
   communicating something which can increase the reader's understanding.

2. The reader is able to overcome this inequality to some degree and approach
   equality with the writer.

Note, it is possible to be mistaken in your judgment of something you're
reading. So, the beginning of reading as a conscious effort to understand is an
accurate perception of the difference.

From many rules to one habit
****************************

:Abstract: 
    Reading is a `complex skill`_.

    Reading is either intrinsic_ or extrinsic_.
    
    Intrinsic reading consists of understanding_ and criticism_.

    Understanding_ consists of analysis and synthesis.

Three ways of reading
================================================================================

.. 124

A good book deserves three readings.

1.  Understanding_

    1. Analytic Reading
    2. Synthetic Reading

2.  Critical

    3. Critical Reading

These three readings are not three in time, but three in manner: three ways of
reading a book.

The first two readings are reading for understanding. As a reader becomes
expert, these may be performed simultaneously. The third is distinct, as a
reader must understand an author before criticizing him.

The first two readings and the third must be done somewhat separately;
understanding the author must always precede criticizing or judging him.

.. 126

    If you had to check your reading of a book, you would have to divide the
    whole process into its parts. You might have to re-examine separately each
    step you took, though at the time you did not take it separately, so
    habitual had the process of reading become.

.. 127

    The teacher of English composition, going over a paper with a student and
    explaining his marks, points to this or that rule the student violated. At
    that time, the student must be reminded of the different rules, but the
    teacher does not want him to write with a rule sheet before him. He wants
    him to write well habitually, as if the rules were part of his nature. The
    same is true of reading.

Reading 1: |reading 1|

Here the reader proceeds from the whole to its parts.

Rules for the first reading:

#. |rule 1.1|_
#. |rule 1.2|_
#. |rule 1.3|_
#. |rule 1.4|_

Knowing `what the whole book is about <rule 1.2_>`_ and `what its main
divisions are <rule 1.3_>`_ will help you discover its leading terms and
propositions. If you can discover what the chief contentions of the author are
and how he supports these by arguments and evidence, you will be aided in

Here the reader proceeds from the parts to the whole.

The reader focuses on terms, propositions, and syllogisms; the author's ideas,
assertions, and arguments.

Rules for the second reading:

Reading 3: |reading 3|
----------------------

Here the reader judges the author, and decides whether he agrees or disagrees.

.. At this point we have seen rules 1.1, 

Intrinsic reading & Extrinsic reading
=====================================

We distinguish between:

#. `intrinsic reading`_
#. `extrinsic reading`_

.. 127

Rule 0:
    |rule 0|

If authors are agreeing or disagreeing, one cannot be assured one understands
one of them unless they recognize such agreements and disagreements.

This applies especially to the `great books`_-- many of them are
difficult to read because they are related and have been written in a certain
order, such that reading earlier books may help understanding later books.

*see* `chapter 14`_

Rules of `extrinsic reading`_:

1.  Read related books in relation to each other and in an order which renders
    the later ones more intelligible


Criteria for rules of intrinsic reading
=======================================

1. The rules of intrinsic reading also apply to lectures
2. The rules only apply to reading a `whole` book, not to excerpts
3. The rules only apply to liberal arts, not fine arts

.. 129

The rules of intrinsic reading also apply to lectures
------------------------------------------------------

The rules of `intrinsic reading`_ apply equally to reading a book and to taking
a course of lectures.

Lectures require more expertise from users to be profitable:

-   Lectures require a greater exercise of memory or note taking than books
-   Books may be reexamined


.. 130

The rules only apply to reading a `whole` book, not to excerpts
---------------------------------------------------------------

The primary aim of these rules is to help you read a whole book; they would be
misused if applied mainly to excepts or small parts out of context.

One should not read small pieces spaced over time:

- Excerpts are far too short for a sustained effort of reading.
- The order in which excerpts are read make it impossible to grasp and real
  whole concept in itself or to understand one thing in relation to another.

.. TODO: This is extremely hazy and should be revised.


.. 132

Fine arts & Liberal arts
========================

We distinguish between two large classes of books: `fine art`_ and
`liberal art`_ which differ on:

1. Intention of the author
2. The satisfaction its afford readers

`Fine arts`_ and `liberal arts`_ require different `complex skills`_ to
appreciate. Both skills are necessary for decent literacy since few books fit
neatly into either class, and many `great books`_, especially works of history,
intentionally do not. [#]_

.. 135

Books which treat of the appreciation or criticism of `fine art`_ are themselves
`liberal arts`_. [#]_ After reading this book you can read those and learn how
to read the other way. In general, you will find the greatest help from those
books which formulate the rules and exemplify them in practice. [#]_

.. 137

Read books with a purpose
=========================

One should satisfy one's purpose by going to a book written with a similar
intention, but know the same book can be read in different ways and according
to different purposes (do not make the mistakes of `purism`_ or `obscurantism`_).
The author may have had more than one intention, although one is likely to be
primary and dictate the obvious character of the book. Whatever you do in the
way of reading, you must know what you are doing and obey the rules for doing
that sort of things. There is no error in reading a poem as if it were
philosophy so long as you know which you are doing at a given time and how to
do it well.

**************************
Catching on from the title
**************************

:Pages: 140-160 (20)
:Abstract:
    It is important to know what kind of book one is reading before reading it
    because different kinds of books cannot be read in the same way. The
    primary kinds of `expository books`_ are `theoretical books`_ and
    `practical books`_. One may further classify `theoretical books`_  as
    `history`_, `science`_, or `philosophy`_. One can usually classify a book
    before reading it by reading it `front matter`_. One can identify specific
    kinds of books with specific rules.

.. 141
.. _rule 1.1:
.. |rule 1.1| replace:: Classify the book according to kind and subject matter

Rule 1.1: |rule 1.1|
====================

*You must know what kind of (`expository`_) book you are reading, and you should
know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to
read*

.. 158

This is because different `kinds of books`_ exist, which each have different
kinds of knowledge to communicate and different problems to solve, which
require different methods to solve and different methods of writing to explain,
which require different kinds of reading to follow. If a reader does not know
the kind of book he is reading, he will become perplexed and he may be unable
to ask or answer a large number of questions about the book.

.. 147

Kinds of books
--------------

A good reader must not only be able to classify books as the same kind, he
also needs to know what kinds there are. Many schemes of classification
exist, but we need one which groups books with an eye to the problems of
reading, and not for the purpose of selling them or putting them on shelves.
We primarily classify `expository books`_ as `theoretical`_ or `practical`_
and may further classify `theoretical books`_  as `history`_, `science`_, or 
`philosophy`_. [#]_


How to classify books
---------------------

One often can classify a book by studying its `front matter`_. This is
preferable to classifying a book by reading it, since it is useful to know what
kinds of book one is reading before reading. Be aware that front matter may be
misleading, and that some books cannot be neatly classified, often because
unskilled authors are unaware of distinctions.

.. 149

Practical books can be identified by noticing "the art of", "how to", or the
names of practical fields (such as  economics, ethics, and politics) in the
title, identifying it as a manual, guidebook, oration, political speech, or
moral treatise, identifying persuasive writing, noticing it tells you either
what you `should` do or `how` to do it, and noticing frequent occurrence of
such words as "should", "ought", "good", "bad", "ends", "means", "better",
"worse", "right", and "wrong".

`History`_ books can usually be identified by spotting "history" in the title
or being informed by the front matter that a book is about the past. `Science`_
and `philosophy`_ books are harder to identify because they are easy to mistake
for each other since both have titles that are the name of the subject matter
that they deal with, both seek general truths, and both claim frequently claim
the same subjects. Roughly though, if a `theoretical book`_ refers to things
which lie outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily experience, it is
scientific, otherwise it is philosophical, since science requires special
observation for support which requires elaborate experiments, but philosophy
needs only common observations ("armchair thinking").


.. 160

*******************
Seeing the skeleton
*******************

:Pages: 160-185 (25)
:Abstract:
    To grasp a complex entity like a book, one must grasp its `unity`_ and its
    `complexity`_. One should do this by writing a concise statement of the
    unity, a blueprint of its structure, and noting the problems the author is
    trying to solve.

.. _rule 1.2:

Rule 1.2: |rule 1.2|
====================

The `unity`_ of a book determines the arrangement of its parts. Thus, the
writer's task is to have one that is perfect and pervasive and the reader's task
is to find it. The reader can only find the `unity`_ of a book by reading it
entirely. This is because fiction books rarely state the `unity`_ to keep the
reader in suspense (as with fiction few plots exist in the world) and
`expository`_ books, though they typically state the `unity`_ early to convince
the reader of reading through, occasionally diverge from it.

The only way to test whether one understands the `unity`_ is to state it
as well as possible. A `unity`_ is stated well insofar as it is concise,
accurate, comprehensive, and indicative of a book's structure. As quite
different statements may be equally good or bad, readers may state the unity in
various ways, including ways different than the writer.

.. 163
.. _rule 1.3:

Rule 1.3: |rule 1.3|
====================

Though the major parts of a book may be seen at the moment when you grasp its
`unity`_, these parts are usually themselves complex and have an interior
structure you must see. Hence the third rule involves more than just an
enumeration of the parts: it means treating the parts as if they were
subordinates wholes, each with a `unity`_ and `complexity`_ of its own.

Complete analysis is expensive, [#]_ even for `great books`_ which have the most
intelligible structure, and the reader should do so only insofar as he profits.
The reader may use the writer's chapters headings and sectional divisions as an
aid, but he must make his own blueprint since writers try to conceal the
structure artistically and often fail to keep it intact.

.. _rule 1.4:

Rule 1.4: |rule 1.4|
====================

This rule repeats in another form `rule 1.2`_ and `rule 1.3`_: A reader should
be able to precisely formulate the main problems (or questions) and their subordinate
problems and be able to put them in an intelligible order. This rule is most
pertinent to the `great books`_, since as `original communications`_ the authors
started out with problems and ended by writing the solutions. The reader may
improve his ability to detect an author's problems by studying the kinds of
questions anyone can ask about anything. [#]_

***************
Coming to terms
***************

:Pages: 185-209 (24)

Coming to terms is the first stage of interpretation. Unless the reader comes to
terms with the author, the communication of knowledge from one to the other does
not take a place.

.. _rule 2.1:

Rule 2.1: |rule 2.1|
====================

    One of the primary rules for reading anything is to spot the most important
    words the author uses. Spotting them is not enough, however. You have to
    know how they are being used. Find an important word merely begins the more
    difficult research for the meanings, one or more, common or special, which
    the word is used to convey as it appears here and there in the text.

..

    When you start out to investigate the various senses of a word, it is
    usually wise to begin with a dictionary and you known own knowledge of
    common knowledge.

Find the most important words and through them `come to terms`_ with the author.
(187)

Note that the rule has two parts. (Each rule for the second reading does)

1. Locate the words which make a difference
2. Determine their meanings, as used, with precision

Interpreting a book is a kind of detective work. Finding the important words is
locating the clues. Coming to terms through them is running down the author's
thought.

Theses rules have a grammatical and a logical aspect. The grammatical step is
the one which deals with words. The logical step deal with their meanings, or
more precisely, with terms. So far as communicated is concerned, both steps are
indispensable; if language is sued without though, nothing is being
communicated.

As arts, grammar and logic are concerned with language in relation to though and
though in relation to language.

    That is why I said earlier that skill in reading and writing is gained
    through these liberal arts, especially grammar and logic. (where? that is an
    interesting argument)

.. 188

Language
========

If language were a pure and perfect medium for thought, these steps would not be
separate; interpretation would be unnecessary. Given that language is not ideal,
the only reasonable thing to do is make the best of language as it is, and the
only way to do that is to use language as skillfully as possible.

Because language is an imperfect medium, it also functions as an obstacle to
communication. **The rules of interpretative reading are directed to overcoming
that obstacles.**

We can expect a good writer to do his best to reach us through the barrier
language inevitably sets up, but we cannot expect him to do it all. In fact, we
must him halfway. The chance of meeting of minds through language depends on the
willingness of both reader and writer to work toward each other just as teaching
will not avail unless there is reciprocal activity of being taught.

The reciprocity here is founded on the fact that the rules of good reading and
writing are ultimately the same in principle.

How to
======

How does the reader find the important words in a book?

Eliminate ordinary words
------------------------

Most of the words an author uses are unimportant and used in an everyday sense
(one qualification: words at different times and place are not the same). Only
those words which he uses in a special way are important for him, and for us as
readers. This is a matter of degree: words may be more or less important.

You cannot locate the important words without making an effort to understand the
passage in which they occur. This is somewhat paradoxical, as if you understand
the passage you will of course know which words in it are the most important.

If you are mark the words that trouble you, you may hit the very ones the author
is using specially. That this is likely to be so follows form the fact that you
should have no trouble with the words the author uses in an ordinary way. From
your point of view as a reader, the most important words are those which give
you trouble.

Positive signs
--------------

1. Explicit stress an author places upon certain words and not others.

   He may do this in several ways.

   - Typographical devices, as quotation marks or italics.
   - Explicitly discussing it various senses and the way he is going to use it
     here and there.
   - Giving a precising definition.
   - Quarrels with other writers about it.

Every field of knowledge has its own technical vocabulary, which must be
discovered by the reader.

If the author has not pointed out the words himself, the reader may locate them
through having some prior knowledge of the subject matter. If you know what kind
of book it is, what it is about as a whole, and what its major parts are, you
are greatly aided in separate the technical vocabulary from the ordinary words.

Unfortunately, there are many field in which a technical vocabulary is not well
established. Philosophers are notorious for having private vocabularies. They
often find it necessary to coin new words or to overload an existing word.

----

Remember that spotting the important words is only the beginning of the task. It
merely locates the places in the text where you have to go to work. There is
another step is carrying out this first rule of interpretative reading.

Let us suppose that you have the marked the words that trouble you. What next?

Two major possibilities:

1. The author is using these words in a single sense throughout.

   Here the words stand for a single term, as in Euclid.

2. The author is using them in two or more senses, shifting his meaning from
   place to place

   Here the word stands for several terms, as in Locke. This is the more usual
   case.

Procedure:

1. Try to determine whether the word has one or many meanings.
2. If many, try to see whether they are related and how.
3. Note the places where the word is use in one sense or another, and see if the
   context gives you any clues to the reason for the shift in meaning.

   This will enable you to follow the word in its change of meanings with the
   same flexibility that characterizes the author's usage.

How does one find out what the meaning are? There is only one way. You have to
discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meanings of
all the other words in the context which you do understand. This is not an easy
job, but is possible.

A good jigsaw puzzle is one all of whose parts fits; the picture can be
perfectly completed. The same is true of the ideally good book. But there are
few books of this sort. In proportion as they are good, their terms will be so
well made and put together by the author that the reader can do the work
interpretation fruitfully.

====================

.. _rule 2.3:

Rule 2.3: |rule 2.3|
====================

Find if you can the paragraphs in a book which state its important arguments;
but if the argument are not thus expressed, your task is `construct` them, by
taking a sentence from this paragraph, and one from that, until you have
gathered together the sequence of sentences which the state the propositions
that composed the argument.

.. tip::

   Remember that every argument must involve a number of statements. Of these,
   some give the reasons why you should accept a conclusion the author is
   proposing. If you find find the conclusions first, then look for the
   reasons. If you find the reasons first, see what they lead to. (231)

.. tip::

   Discriminate between the kind of argument which points to one or more
   particular facts as evidence for some generalization and the kind which
   offers a series of general statements to prove some further generalizations.

   General propositions which are called self-evident, or axioms, are
   propositions we know to be true as soon as we understand their terms. Such
   propositions are ultimately derived from our experience of particulars. (231)

   - what he says can be proved or otherwise evidenced
   - what need not be proved because it is self-evident

Rule 2.4: |rule 2.4|
====================

*****************************
The etiquette of talking back
*****************************

:Pages: 235-251 (16)

Reading a book is a kind of conversation. The reader has the last word, but
the reader must not be judge before reading fully because the author cannot
defend himself.

    Ordinary conversations between persons who confront each other are good
    only when they are carried on decently. I am not thinking merely of the
    decencies according to conventions of social politeness. There is in
    addition, an intellectual etiquette one should observe. Without it,
    conversation is bickering rather than profitable communication. I am
    assuming here, of course, that the conversation is about a serious matter
    on which men can agree or disagree. Then it becomes important that they
    conduct themselves well. Otherwise there is no profit in the enterprise.
    The profit in good conversation is something learned.

The things the reader can say

:Pages: 235-266 (15)

If the reader does not understand and if the fault is with the book, rather than
with the reader, the reader must locate the sources of trouble. He should be
able to do show that its structure is unintelligible. To the extent that a
reader can support his charge that a book is unintelligible, he has no further
critical obligations.

Let us suppose you are a reading a good book and understand it. If you agree
with what the author says, the work is over. You have been enlightened,
convinced, or persuaded. This is the usual case.

The reader must be acquainted with the principles of argument. The reader can
ultimately reach significant agreement or disagreement with the author only by
meeting the author's arguments, not by simply following them.

The reader who `comes to terms` with an author and grasps his propositions and
reasoning, is *en rapport* with the author's mind.

.. 252. I think this is an important note:

Aside: The whole process of interpretation is directed toward a meeting of minds
through the medium of language. Understanding a book can be described as a kind
of agreement between writer and reader. They agree about the use of language to
express idea.

************************
And still more rules
************************

:Pages: 266-291 (25)

There are a few point to make about the utility of looking outside the book you
are reading in order to read it well.

In any art, rules have a disappointing way of being too general. The more
general, the fewer, but also the more remote they are from the intricacies  of
the actual situation in which you try to follow them.

So far the rules have been stated generally enough to apply to any instructive
book, but you cannot read a book in general.

The most important thing about any practical book is that it can never solve the
practical problems with which it is concerned. Action is required. This is in
contrast to a theoretical book, which can solve its own problems.

Every action takes place in a particular situation under special circumstances.
You cannot act in general. The kind of practical judgment which immediately
precedes action must be highly particular.

A book rarely will give such concrete advice, so rarely is such advice is every
written. Only someone in the same exact situation could help.

Practical books fall into two main groups. Those the primarily present rules (of
which, no great books are) and those that are primarily concerned with the
principles which generate rules (e.g. great books in economics, politics, and
morals).

In reading a book which is primarily a rulebook, the major propositions too look
for, of course, are the rules. You can always recognize a rule because it
recommend something as worth doing to gain a certain end. The arguments in a
practical book will be attempts to show you that the rules are sound. The writer
may appeal to principles or simply illustrate their soundness by showing how
they work in on concrete cases. The former is less persuasive, but it can
explain the reason for the rules better than examples of their use can.

In the other kind, the major of propositions and arguments will look exactly
like those in a purely theoretical book. The propositions will say that
something is the case, and the arguments will try to show that it is so.
However, there is an important difference between reading a such a book and a
purely theoreitcal one- since ultimate problems to be solved are practical, an
intelligent reader always readings between the lines and see the rules which may
not be expressed, but may be derived from the general principles. Unless it is
so read, a practical book is not read as practical, and is read poorly. You
really do not understand it, and certainly cannot criticize it properly in any
other way.

In judging a theoretic book, the reader must observe the discrepancy between his
own basic assumptions and those of the author. In judging a partical book,
everything turns on the ends or goals, not the means.

Two clues to the major questions you must ask about yourself in reading any sort
of practical book:

1. What are the author's objectives?
2. What means is he proposing?

Answering both of these is necessary for the understanding and criticism of a
practical book.

Since the ultimate judgment of a practical work is based on its ends, the author
must be something of an orator or propagandist. There is nothing wrong or
vicious about this; it is the nature of practical affairs. No one makes serious
practical judgments or engages in action without being moved somehow from below
the neck. The writer of practical books who does not realize this will be
ineffective.

.. 274 todo: resume at "The best protection..."

.. 280 - Extrinsic reading scientific work

Scientific work
    The report of findings or conclusions in some field of research, whether
    carried on experimentally in a laboratory or by observations of nature in
    the raw.

The scientific problem is always to describe the phenomena as accurately as
possible and to trace the interconnections among different kinds of phenomena.

In the great works of science, there is no oratory or propaganda, though there
may be bias in the sense of initial presuppositions. You can detect this by
distinguishing what the author assumes from what he establishes through
argument. The more objective a scientific author is, the more he will explicitly
beg you to take this or that for granted. Scientific objectivity is not the
absence of initial bias; it is attained by a frank confession of it.

The leading terms in a scientific work are usually expressed by uncommon or
technical words. They are relatively easy to spot. Through them you can readily
grasp the propositions. The main propositions are always general ones, since
science tries to say how things are generally.

The only point of difficulty is with respect to arguments. Science is primarily
inductive. To understand and judge the inductive arguments in a scientific book,
you must be able to follow the evidence which the scientists reports as their
basis. Sometimes descriptions or diagrams illustrate the phenomena. In the worst
case the reader must get the special experience for himself first hand (perhaps
at a museum). This is reason why a good school would require laboratory work for
students.

> The scientific classics become more intelligible to those who have seen with
their own eyes and done with their own hands what a great scientist describes as
as the procedure by which he reached his insights.

**Thus, the major extrinsic aid in the read of scientific books is not the
reading of other books, but rather getting a direct acquaintance with the
phenomena involved.**

Other books may be helpful, but the primary aid is experiment.

.. 282 - Philosophical

Ethical and political books have already been treated. (practical philosophy)

Here we treat theoretic works, such as metaphysics.

The philosophical problem is to explain, not to describe, the nature of things.
It asks more about the connection of phenomena. It seeks to penetrate to the
ultimate causes and conditions of things.

The basic terms of philosophy and science are abstract. No general knowledge is
expressible except in abstract terms. Whenever you talk generally about anything
you are using abstractions.

Just as the inductive argument should be the reader's main focus in the case of
scientific books, so here you must pay closest attention to the philosopher's
principles or beginnings.

.. todo: skipped a lot to 286

There are two further points about extrinsic reading in connection with
philosophical books:

1. Do not spend all your time reading books about the philosophers, their lives,
   and opinions. Trying reading the philosophers themselves, in relation to one
   another.

2. Note the data of the philosopher you are reading. This will place his
   properly in the conversation with those who cam before and after, and prper
   you for the sort of scientific imagery he will employ to illustrate some of
   his points.

.. 288 - Summary

Summary:

What lies beyond the book you are reading? Three things:

1. Experience, common or special

2. Other books (of various sorts: reference books, secondary books,
   commentaries, other great books, dealing with the same or related matters)

3. Live discussion

    > I like to think of the great books as involved in a prolonged conversation
    about the basic problems of mankind. The great authors were great readers,
    and one way to understand them is to read the books they read. As readers,
    they carried on a conversation with other authors, just as each of us
    carries on a conversation with the books we read, though we may not write
    other books.

    To get into conversations, we must read the great books in relation to each
    other and in an order that somehow respects chronology. The conversation of
    the books takes place in time.

    While this is not indispensable, it is certainly a great help. Hence, why
    teachers meet with students to discuss them. The reader who learns to
    discuss a book well with other with other readers may come thereby to have
    better conversations with the author when he has him alone in his study.

Following all the rules of intrinsic reading is seldom sufficient to read any
book well, either interpretatively or critically. Experience and other books
are dispensable extrinsic aids.

The utility of extrinsic reading is simply an extension of the value of context
in read a book by itself. We have seen how the context must be used to interpret
words and sentences to find terms and propositions. Just as the whole book is a
context for any of its parts, so related books provide an even larger context
that helps you interpret the ones you are reading.

Are you reading for information or understanding?

Heuristic: Anything easily digested is reading for information

*   Newspaper

Claim: not really learning anything new

You need to find writers who are more knowledgable on a particular subject than yourself.

Mortimery Adler wrote the book on reading in "How to Read a Book". Identified four levels of reading:

1.  Elementary

    The level of reading taught in our elementary schools.

2.  Inspectional

    Inspectional reading allows us to look at the authors blueprint and evaluate
    the merits of a deeper reading experience

    There are two types of inspectional reading:

    1.  Systematic skimming

        This is meant to be a quick check of the book by:

        1.  Reading the preface
        2.  Studying the table of contents
        3.  Checking the index
        4.  Reading the inside jacket

        This should give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in
        the book pivotal to the authors argument.

        Skimming helps you reach a decision point: Does this book deserve more
        of my time and attention?

    2.  Superficial reading

3.  Analytical

    Analytical reading is a thorough reading; the best you can do given an
    unlimited time.

    Rules to analytic reading:

    -   Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
    -   State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity
    -   Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole
    -   Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve

    Though these may sound easy, they involve a lot of work.

    When you're done this, you may understand the book but not the broader
    subject. To do this, you need to use comparative reading to synthesize
    knowledge from several books on the same subject.

4.  Syntopical

    This is also known as comparative reading and it represents the most
    demanding and difficult reading of all.

    Syntopical reading involves reading many books on the same subject and
    comparing and contrasting ideas.

    There are five steps to syntopical reading:

    1. Find the relevant passages
    2. Bring the author to terms
    3. Get the questions clear
    4. Define the issues
    5. Analyze the discussion

These are thought of as levels because you can't move to a higher level without
a firm understanding of the previous one.

The goal of reading determines how you read. The goal of reading a romance novel
is different from reading the newspaper which is different from reading Plato.

.. _criticism:

Criticism
    To judge whether what is being offered is really acceptable as knowledge

.. 185
.. _come to terms:

Come to terms
    When in any context one knows precisely what another means when certain
    words are used.

    If the author uses a word in one meaning, and the reader reads it in
    another, words have passed between them but they have not come to terms.

    There are degrees of success.

.. 186
.. _communication:

Communication
    An effort on the part of one man to share some with another: his knowledge,
    his decisions, his sentiments.

    Root is related to the word "common".
    
    Communication succeeds only when it results in a common something, as an
    item of knowledge which two men have in common. When there is unresolved
    ambiguity in communication, there is no communication, or at best it must be
    incomplete.
   
    Successful communication occurs in any case where what the writer wanted to
    have received finds its way into the reader's possession. The writer's and
    reader's skill converge upon a common end.

    For communication to be successful, it is necessary for two parties to use
    the same words with the same meanings.

.. 119

.. _complex skill:
.. _complex skills:

Complex skill
    A skill which depends on many other simpler skills in order to be performed
    effectively.

    During the acquisition of a complex skill, each of its component skills
    must be done separately and consciously, but they can be done together
    and unconsciously when we are expert.

    *example* tennis, driving a car, reading

.. _complexity:

Complexity
    The parts and organization of parts of a complex entity.

.. 129
.. _extrinsic:
.. _extrinsic reading:

Extrinsic reading
    Reading a book in the light of other books.

    Other books may be only reference books, secondary books or other great
    books.

    We may also necessarily use relevant experience as an extrinsic aid.

.. 132
.. _fine art:
.. _fine arts:

Fine art
    Art in which the artist aims to please or delight by making beautiful
    things to be beheld

    Roughly, poetry.

    *focus* beauty, narrative writing

.. 143
.. _front matter:

Front matter
    The front matter consists of:

    - the title
    - the subtitle
    - table of contents
    - preface

.. _great book:
.. _great books:
.. _great work:
.. _great works:

Great work
    pass

.. _history:

History
    History is knowledge of particular events or things which not only existed
    in the past, but underwent a series of changes in the course of time.

    The historian narrates these happenings and often colors his narrative
    with some comment on, or insight into, the significance of the events.

.. 129
.. _intrinsic:
.. _intrinsic reading:

Intrinsic reading
    Reading a book in itself, apart from all other books.

.. _learning_curve:

Learning curve
    A graphical representation of a person's skill versus their experience,
    which is typically curved due to improvement in skill becoming harder as
    experience increases.

.. _learning_plateau:

Learning plateau
    A span of time in which a learner's skill remains constant despite
    additional experienced.
    
    Learning plateaus are not found in all learning curves, but only in those
    which record progress in gaining a `complex skill`_. The more complex the
    skill, the more frequently learning plateaus appear.

    Learning goes on during learning plateaus, but it does not manifest as
    an improvement in skill.
    
    One explanation is that during a learning plateau the learner combines
    simple acts into a complex one, and only when he has mastered the complex
    act does his skill visibly improve. Thus, in order to perform a complex act
    (like reading or playing tennis) one needs to master each of its component 
    acts (such that they become automatic), and then master them in
    combination. (One cannot think about beating one's opponent in tennis
    until one can reliably return a ball.)

.. 142
.. _expository:
.. _expository book:
.. _expository books:

Expository book
    A book which conveys knowledge primarily.

.. 132
.. _liberal art:
.. _liberal arts:

Liberal art
    Art in which the artist aims to instruct by speaking the truth

    Roughly, science.

    *focus* truth, expository writing

.. _original communication:
.. _original communications:

Original communication
    TODO: Complete this

.. _obscurantism:

Obscurantism
    The error of supposing that all books can be read in only one way.

    There are two extremes:

    1.  Of estheticism, which regards all books as if they were poetry
    2.  Of intellectualism, which treats all books as if they were instructive

.. _philosophy:

Philosophy
    ?

.. _practical:
.. _practical book:
.. _practical books:

Practical Book
    A book concerned with `action`, `applied science`, or `knowing how` to do
    something which you think you `should`.

.. _purism:

Purism
    The error of supposing that a given book can be read in only one way.

    It is an error because books are not pure in character, and that in turn
    is due to the fact that the human mind, which writes or reads them, is
    rooted in the senses and imagination and moves or is moved by emotion
    and sentiment.

.. _reading:

Reading
    The process of interpreting or understanding what presents itself to the
    senses in the form of words or other sensible marks.

    This is stipulative, and used for defining our problem, which is reading in
    the sense of receiving written communication.

.. _science:

Science
    Science treat of matters that can happen at any time or place.

    Scientists seek laws or generalizations.

    Scientists seek to find out how things happen for the most part or in
    ever case.

    The rules of extrinsic reading are more complicated in the case of scientific
    books. You may actually have have to witness an experiment unless you can use
    your imagination to construct something as you have never observed.

.. 186-187
.. _term:
.. _terms:

Term
    A word used unambiguously.

    All (or at least nearly all) words are ambiguous, but a word which has
    several meanings can be used in one sense at a time.

    Terms do not appear in dictionaries, though the materials for making them
    are there. Terms occur only in the process of communication.
    
    Terms are basic elements of communicable knowledge.

    A term is not a word. A word may be ambiguous, especially an important word.

.. _theoretical:
.. _theoretical book:
.. _theoretical books:

Theoretical Book
    A book concerned with `knowledge`, `pure science`, or `knowing that`.

.. 123
.. _understanding:

Understanding
    To grasp what is being offered as knowledge

    To understand some thing, one must approach it:

    1. First, as a whole, having unity and a structure of parts
    2. Second, in terms of its elements, its units of language and thought

.. 162

.. _unity:

Unity
    The unity of a book is what it is about, its purpose, theme, or main point.

    One obvious fact shows the existence of a wide range of degrees in the
    ability to read is that reading begins in the primary grades and runs
    through every level of the educational system. Since what we have to learn,
    as we ascend in our education, becomes more difficult or complex, we must
    improve our ability to read proportionately.

    Supposedly, gradations in reading go along with graduations from one
    educational level to another. This supposition is not well founded, however,
    as in the US, there is little discernible difference between the literacy of
    a high school student and a college senior. But, this fact means only that
    the gradations have become more obscure for us, not that they do not exist.

.. [8]
    The accuracy of such measurement depends, of course, on the independent
    precision with which we can grade the tasks in difficulty. We would be
    moving in circles if we said, for instance, that the more difficult book is
    one which only the better reader can master.

    In order to understand what makes some books more difficult to read than
    others, we would have to know what demands they make on the skill of the
    reader.

    The difficulty of the reading matter is a convenient, objective sign of
    degrees of reading ability, but it does not tell us what the difference is
    in that reader, so far as his skill is concerned.

.. [11]
    Adler tells a story:

    Here is a book, I said, and here is your mind. The book consists of language
    written by someone for the sake of communicating something to you. Your
    success in reading is determined by the extent to which you get all that
    writer intended to communicate.

    Now, as you go through the pages either you understand perfectly everything
    the author has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained
    information, but you could not have increased understand. If upon effortless
    inspection, a book is completely intelligible to you, then the author and
    you are as two minds in the same mold. The symbols on the page merely
    express the common understanding your had before you met.

    Let us take the second alternative. You do not understand the book perfectly
    at once. Let us assume even that you understand enough to know you do not
    understand it all. You know there is more in the book than you understand
    and hence, that the book contains something which can increase your
    understanding. What do you do then?

    You can do a number of things.

    You can take the book to someone else who, you think, can read better than
    you, and have him explain the parts that troubled you.

    Or you can get him to recommend a textbook or commentary which will make it
    all plain by telling you what the author meant.

    Or you may decide, as many students do, that what's over your head isn't
    worth bothering about, that you understand enough, and the rest doesn't
    matter.

    If you do any of these things, you are not doing the job of reading which
    the book requires. That is done in one way only. Without external help, you
    take the book into your study and work on it. With nothing but the power of
    your mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that you
    gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of
    understanding more.

    Such elevation, accomplished by the mind working on a book, is reading, the
    kind of reading that a book which challenges your understanding deserves.

    Thus I roughly defined what I mean by reading: the process whereby a mind,
    with nothing to operate on the but the symbols of readable matter, and with
    not help from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations.
    The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more.

    The operations which causes this to happen are the various acts which
    constitute the art of reading. "How many of these acts do you know?" I asked
    three thousand teachers. "What things would you do by yourself if your lif
    depended on understanding something readable which at first perusal left you
    somewhat in the dark?"
