How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading
================================================================================

:Author: Mortimer Adler
:Publisher: Simon and Schuster
:Address: 630, Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10020
:Date: 1966 (Original work published 1940)
:Read: December 2013
:Pages: 397
:Abstract:
    This is a book for the average reader, whose main purpose is to read
    `expository books`_ to increase his understanding; he may experience
    difficulties in reading, but he does not know why nor what to do about it.
    
    Knowing how to read well is like any other art_: it is a complex activity,
    involving many different rules and steps, in each of which we can acquire
    more skill through practice, and where mastery presents difficulties to be
    overcome by effort and time.

    This book has only two functions to perform: to interest you in the profit
    of reading and to assist you in cultivating the art; therefore, it aims to
    encourage and assist you in reading the `great books`_. [9]_

:Abstract:
    This part is about the nature of reading in general, the various kinds of
    reading, and the relation of the art of reading to the art of being taught
    in school and out. It considers, therefore, the serious consequences of the
    neglect of reading in contemporary education, suggesting as a solution that
    books can be substituted for living teachers if individuals can help
    themselves learn how to read.

art`_.

**Fine art** is art in which the artist aims to please or delight others by
making beautiful things to be beheld. It deepens our sensitivity to human
values; it increases our humanity. Fine art manifests itself in literature as
poetry or narrative writing. *We do not treat fine art.* [18]_

**Learning** is the process of acquiring knowledge. The two methods of learning
are discovery_ and instruction_.

Reading for information & Reading for understanding
================================================================================

`Reading for instruction`_ may be divided into `reading for information`_
and `reading for understanding`_.


----

`Expository books`_ may be classified as `theoretical`_ or `practical`_. We
`read for information`_ for `read for understanding`_ when we read expository
books.

`Theoretical books`_ may be classified as `history`_, `science`_, or
`philosophy`_. [#]_

Since reading of any sort is an activity, all reading must to some degree be
active. Hence, when we contrast active with passive reading, our purpose is,
first, to call attention to the fact that reading can be more or less active,
and second, to point out that the more active the reading, the better.

The failure of contemporary education with respect to reading
********************************************************************************
:Pages: 65-101 (`"The defeat of the schools"`)

:Abstract:
   1. Various evidences are recited, giving the writer's personal experiences
      with the inability of students to read.

   2. The relation of reading to such other skills as writing and speaking
      are discussed with respect to current educational defects.

   3. The results of scientific educational measurements are reported to
      show the lack of these skills in the graduates of our schools.

   4. Other evidences, especially from book publishers, are offered as
      correlating evidence to these findings.

   5. An attempt is made to explain why the schools have failed.


The relation of reading to writing and speaking
================================================================================

The lack of reading for understanding in schools
================================================================================

Overemphasis on information, rather than understanding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Textbooks, popularizations, and ordinary classroom lectures are designed to
to communicate information without requiring skillful activity on the part of
the learner. Unfortunately, this means at best they can stuff the mind rather
than enlighten it. Their proliferation in our educational system today is the
surest sign of our declining literacy.

A natural consequence is that secondary teachers are given priority over primary
teachers.

Overemphasis on discovery, rather than instruction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Schools spend much more time on training students how to discover_ than on
training them how to receive instruction_.

A balanced education must place a just emphasis on both types of learning and
on the arts they require. There is no particular virtue in wasting time to find
out for yourself what has already been discovered. One should save one's skill
in research for what has not yet been been discovered, and exercise one's skill
in being taught for learning what others already know and therefore can teach.

.. todo: why? presumably it is more efficient, but this is not stated.

Why schools have failed
================================================================================

The humbug we teachers have to practice is the front we put on of knowledge and
expertness, but we must not let the humbug fool ourselves. If we do not know
that we cannot read much better than our students, we have allowed our
professional imposture to deceive ourselves. [13]_

The best teachers are those who make the fewest pretensions. The teacher who
shows he is also struggling with books helps students much more than a pedagogue
who appears to get through them with ease.

********************************************************************************
How the contemporary education situation can be remedied
********************************************************************************
:Pages: 101-116 (`On self-help`)

:Abstract:
   1. Any art_ can be acquired by those who will practice according
      to the rules.

   2. It is indicated how the art of reading might be acquired by those who
      did not learn how in school.

   3. It is suggested that by learning how to read, people can compensate
      for the defects of their education.

   4. It is hoped that if people generally understood what an education
      should be, through having learned to read and having read, they would
      take serious steps to reform the failing school system.


Compensating for defects in education
================================================================================

Man's responsibility for his education does not rest entirely on schooling.
Every man must decide for himself whether is satisfied with the education he is
getting or has got, and if he is not satisfied it is up to him to do something
about it.

The self-educated man is as rare as the self-made man. Most men do not
become genuinely learned or amass large fortunes through their own efforts.
The existence of such men, however, shows it can be done. Their rarity
indicates the exceptional qualities of character required. In knowledge, as
in wealth, most of us have to be spoon-fed to the little we possess.

With schools as they are, more schooling is hardly the remedy. One way out --
perhaps the only one available to most people -- is to learn to read better, and
then, by reading better, to learn more of what can be learned through reading.

.. todo: What might be other ways?

.. 58

It happens to be the case, of course, that most of the `primary teachers`_ are
`dead teachers`_ whereas most of the `living teachers` are `secondary
teachers`_. But suppose that we could resuscitate the `primary teachers`_ of all
times. Suppose there was a college or university in which the faculty was thus
composed. Would anyone want to go to any university if he could get into this
one? There need be no limitation on numbers. The price of admission -- the only
entrance requirement -- is the ability and willingness to read.

The `great books` can be read in or out of school. If they are read in school,
in classes under the supervision of `live teachers`_, the latter must properly
subordinate themselves to the dead ones.

For many centuries, education was regarded as the elevation of a mind by its
betters. If we are honest, most of us living teachers should be willing to admit
that, apart from the advantages which age bestows, we are not much better than
our students in intellectual caliber or attainment. If elevation is to take
place, better minds than ours will have to do the teaching.

One might object that great books are too difficult for most of us, in school
our out. That is why we are forced to get our education from secondary teachers,
from classroom lectures, textbooks, popularizations, which repeat and digest for
us what would otherwise forever remain a closed book. Even though our aim is
understanding, not information, we must be satisfied with a less rich diet. We
suffer incurable limitations. The masters are too far above us. This I deny. For
one thing, the less rich diet is likely not be genuinely nourishing at all. The
latter cannot be substituted for the former, because you cannot get the same
thing out of them.

The path of true learning is strewn with rocks, not roses. Anyone who insists
upon taking the easier way ends up in a fool's paradise-- a sophomore all his
life.

The great books can be read by every man. The help he needs from secondary
teachers does not consist of the get-learning-quick substitutes. It consists of
help in learning how to read, and more than that when possible, help actually in
the course of reading the great books.

How to acquire the art of reading outside of school
================================================================================

Hope for reforming education
================================================================================

If somehow, out of school and after it, people generally could get some of the
education they did not get in school, then they might be motivated to change the
school system. People could get the education they did not get, if they could
read. Therefore, the vicious circle would be broken if the general public were
better educated than the standard product of the schools and colleges. It would
break at the point where they would really know themselves the kind of literacy
they would like their children to get.

More than educational reform is at stake. Democracy and the liberal institutions
we have cherished in this country since its founding are in the balance, too.

From many rules to one habit
****************************

:Abstract: 
    Reading is a `complex skill`_.

    Reading is either intrinsic_ or extrinsic_.
    
    Intrinsic reading consists of understanding_ and criticism_.

    Understanding_ consists of analysis and synthesis.

Three ways of reading
================================================================================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

.. 124

A good book deserves three readings.

1.  Understanding_

    1. `Analytic reading`_
    2. `Interpretative reading`_

2.  Critical

    3. Critical reading

There are three ways of reading a book. The first two readings are `reading for
understanding`_.

The third is distinct, as a reader must understand an author
before criticizing him.


As a reader becomes expert, the first two readings may be performed
simultaneously.


----

Relation of analytic reading and interpretative reading:

The major parts of a book and even their principal divisions contain many
propositions and usually several arguments. But if you keep on dividing the book
into its parts, you at last have to say: "In this part, the following points are
made." Now each of these points is likely to be a proposition and some of them
taken together probably form an argument.

Thus the two the first and the second reading meet. You work down to
propositions and arguments by dividing the book into its parts. You work up to
arguments by showing how they are composed of propositions and ultimately of
terms. When you have completed these two readings, you can really say you know
the contents of a book.

Relation to the Trivium
================================================================================

The same principles of grammar and logic underlie rules of good writing as well
as good reading. The principles of rhetoric underlies rules of critical judgment.

The rules of the first two readings concern the achievement of intelligiblity on
the part of the writer and the achievement of understanding on the part of the
reader.

Skill in reading for understanding from a mastery of grammar and logic. Skill in
criticism depends on rhetoric.


On the part of the speaker or writer, rhetorical skill is knowing how to
convince or persuade. Since this is ultimate end in view, all the other aspects
of communication must serve it. Grammatical and logical skill in writing clearly
and intelligibly has virtue in itself, but it is also a means to an end.

Reciprocally, on the part of the reader or listener, rhetorical skill is knowing
how to react to anyone who tries to convince or persuade us. Here, too,
grammatical and logical skill, which enables us to understand what is being
said, prepares the way for a critical reaction.

----

To be equally serious in receiving such communication, one must be not only a
responsive, but a responsible listener. You are responsible to the extent that
you follow what has been said and note the intention which prompts it. But you
also have the responsibility of taking a position.


----

There are many uses of rhetoric. We usually think of it in connection with the
orator or propagandist. But in its most general significance, rhetoric is
involved in every situation in which communication takes place among men takes
place among men. If we are the talkers, we wish not only to be understood but to
be agreed in some sense. If our purpose in trying to persuade is serious, we
wish to convince or persuade -- more precisely, to convince about theoretical
matters and to persuade about matters that ultimately affect action or feeling.

----


.. 126

    If you had to check your reading of a book, you would have to divide the
    whole process into its parts. You might have to re-examine separately each
    step you took, though at the time you did not take it separately, so
    habitual had the process of reading become.

.. 127

    The teacher of English composition, going over a paper with a student and
    explaining his marks, points to this or that rule the student violated. At
    that time, the student must be reminded of the different rules, but the
    teacher does not want him to write with a rule sheet before him. He wants
    him to write well habitually, as if the rules were part of his nature. The
    same is true of reading.





Intrinsic reading & Extrinsic reading
=====================================

We distinguish between `intrinsic reading`_ and `extrinsic reading`_.

.. 127

Rule 0:
    |rule 0|

If authors are agreeing or disagreeing, one cannot be assured one understands
one of them unless they recognize such agreements and disagreements.

This applies especially to the `great books`_-- many of them are
difficult to read because they are related and have been written in a certain
order, such that reading earlier books may help understanding later books.

*see* `chapter 14`_

Rules of `extrinsic reading`_:

1.  Read related books in relation to each other and in an order which renders
    the later ones more intelligible


Criteria for rules of intrinsic reading
=======================================

1. The rules also apply to lectures
2. The rules only apply to reading a *whole* book, not to excerpts
3. The rules only apply to `liberal arts`_, not `fine arts`_

.. 129

The rules of intrinsic reading also apply to lectures
------------------------------------------------------

The rules of `intrinsic reading`_ apply equally to reading a book and to taking
a course of lectures.

Lectures require more expertise from users to be profitable:

-   Lectures require a greater exercise of memory or note taking than books
-   Books may be reexamined


.. 130

The rules only apply to reading a `whole` book, not to excerpts
---------------------------------------------------------------

The primary aim of these rules is to help you read a whole book; they would be
misused if applied mainly to excepts or small parts out of context.

One should not read small pieces spaced over time:

- Excerpts are far too short for a sustained effort of reading.
- The order in which excerpts are read make it impossible to grasp and real
  whole concept in itself or to understand one thing in relation to another.

.. TODO: This is extremely hazy and should be revised.

:Pages:
    140-160 (20) (`Catching on from the title`),
    160-185 (25) (`Seeing the skeleton`)

:Abstract:
    It is important to know what kind of book one is reading before reading it
    because different kinds of books require different kinds of reading. The
    primary kinds of `expository books`_ are `theoretical books`_ and `practical
    books`_. One may further classify `theoretical books`_  as `history`_,
    `science`_, or `philosophy`_. One can usually classify a book before reading
    it by reading it `front matter`_. One can identify specific kinds of books
    with specific rules.

    To grasp a complex entity like a book, one must grasp its `unity`_ and its
    `complexity`_. One should do this by writing a concise statement of the
    unity, a blueprint of its structure, and noting the problems the author is
    trying to solve.

Here the reader proceeds from the whole to its parts.

Knowing `what the whole book is about <rule 1.2_>`_ and `what its main
divisions are <rule 1.3_>`_ will help you discover its leading terms and
propositions. If you can discover what the chief contentions of the author are
and how he supports these by arguments and evidence, you will be aided in
determine the general tenor his treatment and its major divisions.

.. _rule 1.1:
.. |rule 1.1| replace:: Classify the book according to kind and subject matter

Rule 1.1: |rule 1.1|
====================

*You must know what kind of (`expository`_) book you are reading, and you should
know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to
read*

.. 158

This is because different kinds of books exist, which each have different
kinds of knowledge to communicate and different problems to solve, which
require different methods to solve and different methods of writing to explain,
which require different kinds of reading to follow. If a reader does not know
the kind of book he is reading, he will become perplexed and he may be unable
to ask or answer a large number of questions about the book.

A good reader must not only be able to classify books as the same kind, he
also needs to know what kinds there are.

.. 137

Read books with a purpose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One should satisfy one's purpose by going to a book written with a similar
intention, but know the same book can be read in different ways and according
to different purposes (do not make the mistakes of `purism`_ or `obscurantism`_).
The author may have had more than one intention, although one is likely to be
primary and dictate the obvious character of the book.

Whatever you do in the way of reading, you must know what you are doing and obey
the rules for doing that sort of things. There is no error in reading a poem as
if it were philosophy so long as you know which you are doing at a given time
and how to do it well. 

Reading appropriately
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Different kinds of reading are appropriate to different kinds of literature.

`Great books` should be `read for understanding`_; to only `read for
information`_ with these books is a great waste. [14]_ 

`Fine arts`_ and `liberal arts`_ require different `complex skills`_ to
appreciate. Both skills are necessary for decent literacy since many books
cannot be univocally classified, and many `great books`_, especially works of
history, intentionally do not. [#]_

Note, it is possible to misclassify a book. So, the beginning of reading as a
conscious effort to understand is an accurate perception of the differences.

How to classify books
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One often can classify a book by studying its `front matter`_. This is
preferable to classifying a book by reading it, since it is useful to know what
kinds of book one is reading before reading. Be aware that front matter may be
misleading, and that some books cannot be neatly classified, often because
unskilled authors are unaware of distinctions.

`Fine arts` and `liberal arts` can be distinguished by:

1. Intention of the author (to please or to instruct)
2. The satisfaction its afford readers

.. 149

Practical books can be identified by noticing "the art of", "how to", or the
names of practical fields (such as  economics, ethics, and politics) in the
title, identifying it as a manual, guidebook, oration, political speech, or
moral treatise, identifying persuasive writing, noticing it tells you either
what you `should` do or `how` to do it, and noticing frequent occurrence of
such words as "should", "ought", "good", "bad", "ends", "means", "better",
"worse", "right", and "wrong".

`History`_ books can usually be identified by spotting "history" in the title
or being informed by the front matter that a book is about the past. `Science`_
and `philosophy`_ books are harder to identify because they are easy to mistake
for each other since both have titles that are the name of the subject matter
that they deal with, both seek general truths, and both claim frequently claim
the same subjects. Roughly though, if a `theoretical book`_ refers to things
which lie outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily experience, it is
scientific, otherwise it is philosophical, since science requires special
observation for support which requires elaborate experiments, but philosophy
needs only common observations ("armchair thinking").

.. _rule 1.2:

Rule 1.2: |rule 1.2|
====================

The `unity`_ of a book determines the arrangement of its parts. Thus, the
writer's task is to have one that is perfect and pervasive and the reader's task
is to find it. The reader can only find the `unity`_ of a book by reading it
entirely. This is because fiction books rarely state the `unity`_ to keep the
reader in suspense (as with fiction few plots exist in the world) and
`expository`_ books, though they typically state the `unity`_ early to convince
the reader of reading through, occasionally diverge from it.

The only way to test whether one understands the `unity`_ is to state it
as well as possible. A `unity`_ is stated well insofar as it is concise,
accurate, comprehensive, and indicative of a book's structure. As quite
different statements may be equally good or bad, readers may state the unity in
various ways, including ways different than the writer.

.. 163
.. _rule 1.3:

Rule 1.3: |rule 1.3|
====================

Though the major parts of a book may be seen at the moment when you grasp its
`unity`_, these parts are usually themselves complex and have an interior
structure you must see. Hence the third rule involves more than just an
enumeration of the parts: it means treating the parts as if they were
subordinates wholes, each with a `unity`_ and `complexity`_ of its own.

Complete analysis is expensive, [#]_ even for `great books`_ which have the most
intelligible structure, and the reader should do so only insofar as he profits.
The reader may use the writer's chapters headings and sectional divisions as an
aid, but he must make his own blueprint since writers try to conceal the
structure artistically and often fail to keep it intact.

.. _rule 1.4:

Rule 1.4: |rule 1.4|
====================

This rule repeats in another form `rule 1.2`_ and `rule 1.3`_: A reader should
be able to precisely formulate the main problems (or questions) and their subordinate
problems and be able to put them in an intelligible order. This rule is most
pertinent to the `great books`_, since as `original communications`_ the authors
started out with problems and ended by writing the solutions. The reader may
improve his ability to detect an author's problems by studying the kinds of
questions anyone can ask about anything. [#]_

:Pages:
    185-209 (24) (`Coming to terms`),
    209-235 (26) (`What's the proposition and why`)

.. 188

:Abstract:
    The purpose of this reading is to meet minds with the author, by finding his
    ideas (terms), assertions (propositions), and arguments (syllogisms). To
    **come to terms** is to know precisely what another man means when he uses
    certain words in any context. If the author uses a word in one meaning, and
    the reader reads it in another, words have passed between them but they have
    not come to terms.
    
    Given that language is an imperfect medium for communicating thought, there
    are many obstacles to communication which need to be overcome. We can expect
    a good writer to do his best to overcome these obstacles, but we cannot
    expect him to overcome them all; both reader and writer must be willing to
    work toward each other, guided by the principles which underly the rules of
    good reading and writing.

    Interpretation is a skill, and there are degrees of success. The lowest is
    "verbalism", or the habit of using words without regard for the thoughts
    they convey. One succumbs if one passively reads, especially if one is
    reading something in which the important words also happen to be in popular
    usage. The reader who is active rather than passive, is attentive not only
    to the word but to the sentences and paragraphs.

    Each rule for this reading has a grammatical and a logical step: the
    grammatical step deals with words and the logical step deals with their
    meanings. So far as communication is concerned, both steps are
    indispensable; if language is used without thought, nothing is being
    communicated. [17]_

    The reader does not have to follow the rules in order. Though, the reader
    must usually understand lower-level units to understand higher-level units,
    discovering important high-level units may aid discovering important
    low-level units (and of course vice-versa).

    Adler warns he has only touched the most essential points, and hints at
    studying topics in philosophy of language for more information.

Background
================================================================================

One does not need to be a trained logician to spot the argument; most books are
intended for the general reader, not for specialists in logic. Nevertheless some
background is helpful.

- A term is a concept. 

- A proposition asserts a relation between terms. If the proposition is
  self-evident, it is called an axiom. If a proposition is not self-evident, it
  may be called an opinion until a reason is given to support it.

- An argument is a sequence of propositions, some of which give reasons for what
  is to be concluded. If the conclusion follows from the premises, then the
  argument is valid. That does not necessarily mean the conclusion is true,
  because one or more of the premises may be false or only probable.

- A many-to-many relationship exists between words/phrases and terms. Thus,
  different words/phrases may express the same term, and different terms may be
  expressed by the same words/phrases. Not all words/phrases express terms.

- A many-to-many relationship exists between sentences and propositions. Thus,
  different sentences may express the same proposition, and different
  propositions may be expressed the same sentence. Not all sentences express
  propositions.

- Argument necessarily correspond to a sequences of sentences, but do not
  necessarily correspond to a paragraph (e.g. due to digressions or due to an
  author's style of writing many short paragraphs).

The role of the author
================================================================================

In proportion to the author's skill, the author will aid the reader.

- The author may help the reader discover important words by explicitly defining
  or stressing important words. He may use common technical vocabulary, which
  simplifies matters if the reader has prior knowledge of the subject matter.

- A good and honest author helps the reader by making his argument plain. He
  states his assumptions, explains his reasoning (except when they can be can
  omitted without inconvenience due to common knowledge), and summarizes himself
  as his arguments develop.

From the author's point of view, the important sentences are those which express
the judgments on which his whole argument rests.

The role of the reader
================================================================================

The role of the reader is to discover the important expressions and then
interpret them.

Discovering important expressions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A book usually contains much more than the bare statements of an argument. The
author may explain how he came to the point of view he now holds,why he
thinks his position has serious consequences, or discuss the words he has to
use.

The reader has two basic strategies for discovering important expressions:

1. Study expressions which he cannot readily understand. (Since you should not
   have trouble with expression that the author uses in an ordinary way, if you
   have trouble, then it may be important. Note that the common sense of words
   changes with time and place.)

2. For a given linguistic level,  study expressions that belong to higher-level
   units and study expressions that contain lower-level unit.

Arguments may also by identified by the presence of discourse connectives (e.g.
"because", "if ... then"", "since", "therefore", or "it follows").

Interpreting expressions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have the marked a words that trouble you, one can interpret them by:

1. Grouping the places where the author uses the word by sense. (Usually, the
   author will use the same word with different senses.)

2. Finding the meaning using context, common knowledge, and reference material.

No rule of thumb exists for finding the meaning of words. Doing so is sort of
like solving a jigsaw puzzle; as each word is understood, the others are easier
to understand, and occasionally a misunderstood word will cause other words to
be misunderstood as well. Note however, unlike a jigsaw puzzle, it is possible a
bad author may use words that cannot be interpreted.

The reader can interpret the sentences he has found to discover the one or more
propositions they contain by interpreting all the words that make up the
sentence, and especially its principal words. Only two differences exist between
interpreting words and interpreting sentences:

1. The reader employs a larger context in the latter case. He brings all the
   surrounding sentences to bear on the sentence in question, just as he used
   the surrounding words to interpret a particular word.

2. Complicated sentences usually express two or more propositions. You have not
   completed your interpretation until you have separated out of it all the
   different, though perhaps related, propositions it contains.

Testing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reader can test whether or not he has completed this reading successfully by
restating and exemplifying (either imaginatively or by reference to actual
experience) each logical unit. [20]_

If the reader cannot do this, he will not be able to recognize the proposition
if it were presented to him in other words, which is especially important for
`extrinsic reading`_. [19]_

Rule 2.4: |rule 2.4|
================================================================================

The fourth rules governs the last step in the second reading of a book and ties
the second reading together with the first.

Recall that last step in the first reading was the discovery of the major
problems which the author tried to answer in the course of the book. Now after
you have grasped his arguments, you can check what you have found by answering
the following questions:

- Which of the problems that the author tried to solve did he succeed in
  solving?

- In the course of solving these, did he get into any new ones?

- Of the problems he failed to solve, old or new, which did the author know he
  failed on?

A good writer, like a good reader, should know whether a certain problem has
been solved or not, though I can see how it might cost the reader less pain to
acknowledge the failure.

When you are able to answer these questions you can feel reasonably assured that
you have managed to understand the book.

:Abstract:
    Here the reader takes a critical position.

    The reader has an obligation as well as opportunity to talk back. Nothing
    can stop a reader from pronouncing judgment. The roots of the obligation lie
    a little deeper.

    Some of these rules are general maxims of intellectual etiquette. Others are
    more specific criteria for defining the point of criticism.

.. contents::
   :depth: 2
   :local:

The obligation to criticize
================================================================================

There is a tendency to think that a good book is above the criticism of the
average reader. The reader and the author are not peers. The author is subject
to trail only by a jury of his peers. Once an reader has understood a book, they
have elevated themselves almost to peerage with the author. Now they are fit to
exercise the rights and privileges of their new position.

There is no book so good that fault cannot be found with it.

-----

Docility is generally confused with subservience. "docile" is derived from Latin
root which means to teach or be taught. A person is wrongly thought to be docile
if he is passive and pliable. On the contrary, docility is the extremely active
virtue of being teachable. No one is really teachable who does not freely
exercise his power of independent judgment. The most docile reader is,
therefore, the most critical. He is the reader who finally responds to a book by
the greatest effort to make up his own mind on the matters the author has
discussed. I say "finally" because docility requires that a teacher be fully
heard and, more than that, understood, before he is judged.

Critical positions
================================================================================

Many people make the error of identifying criticism with disagreement. But in
fact, the reader can take any of three critical positions:

1. Agree
   
2. Disagree

3. Suspend judgment (taking the position that something has not been shown; that
   you are not convinced or persuaded).

Each requires exercising critical judgment; one can be just as wrong in agreeing
as in disagreeing.

Declaring that one understands
================================================================================

The reader should hesitate to declare that he understands under several
conditions:

- When reading a great book, since, presumably, you have a lot of work to
  do before you declare that honestly understand.

- When reading only part of a book, since it is difficult to be sure that you
  understand.

- When a book is related to other books by the same author, and depends upon
  them for full significance.

To say "I don't understand" is, of course, a critical judgment, but only after
you have tried your hardest does it reflect on the book rather than yourself.
The presumption is in favor of the book, especially if it is a great one. Hence
the reader is obligated to stay with the task of the first two readings a long
time before entering on the third.

If the reader does not understand and if the fault is with the book, rather than
with the reader, the reader must locate the sources of trouble. He should be
able to do show that its structure is unintelligible. To the extent that a
reader can support his charge that a book is unintelligible, he has no further
critical obligations.

Rule 3.1: |rule 3.1|
====================


Rule 3.1.1: |rule 3.1.1|
------------------------

To agree without understanding is inane and to disagree without understanding is
impudent. Thus, do not criticize until you are sure you understand. The reader
who fails to honor this rule, who cannot satisfactorily state the position he
claims to be challenging, should expect to be rightfully ignored.

Rule 3.1.2: |rule 3.1.2|
------------------------

Many people make the mistake of believing that conversation is a battle and
that the goal is to win. Thus, they seek opportunities to disagree on points
they can win, regardless of whether they are right or wrong. But, the only
profit in conversation, with live or dead teachers, is what one can learn from
them; thus it is pointless to be disputatious or contentious.

Rule 3.1.3: |rule 3.1.3|
------------------------

Have reasons for disagreement.

Regard disagreements as capable of being resolved; all rational men can agree,
and hopeless disagreement is mere futile agitation.

Note, I said *can* agree-- I did not say all rational men *do* agree. Men can
only overcome obstacles to agreement to the extent they are rational.

There are two causes of disagreement:

1. Misunderstanding

2. Inequality of knowledge

Thus, all human disagreements can be resolved by the removal misunderstanding or
of ignorance.

The man who at any stage of conversation disagrees, should hope to reach
agreement in the end. He should be as much prepared to have his own mind changed
as seek to change the mind of another. He should always keep before him the
possibility that he misunderstands or that he is ignorant on some point.

(The trouble is that everyone think everything is just a matter of opinion, and
that everyone has a right to an opinion.)

(The ignorant often foolishly disagree with the learned about matters exceeding
their own knowledge. The more learned, however, have a right to be critical of
errors made by those who lack relevant knowledge.)

----

Let us suppose you are a reading a good book and understand it.

If the reader agrees, the work is over; he has been enlightened, convinced, or
persuaded.

If the reader disagrees, he should:

1. Be sure that the disagreement is not due to misunderstanding.

2. Distinguish between knowledge and opinion, and to regard an issue concerning
   knowledge as one which can be resolved.
   
If he pursues the matter further, he may be instructed by the author on points
which change his mind. If that does not happen, he may be justified in his
criticism, and metaphorically at least, be able to instruct the author. He can
at least hope that were the author alive and present, his mind could be changed.

If the author does not give reasons for his propositions, they can be treated
only as expressions of opinion on his part. The reader who does not distinguish
between the reasoned statement of knowledge and the flat expression of opinion
is not reading to learn. He is at most interested in the author's personality
and is using the book as a case history. Such a reader of courses neither agrees
nor disagrees; he does not judge the book but the man.

The distinction between knowledge and opinion applies to him as well as to the
author. The reader must do more than make judgment of agreement or disagreement;
he must give reasons for them. If he agrees, it suffices if he actively shares
the author's reasons for them. If he disagrees, he must give his grounds for
doing so. Otherwise he is treating a matter of knowledge as if it were opinion.

Rule 3.2: |rule 3.2|
====================

The reader must be acquainted with the principles of argument. The reader can
ultimately reach significant agreement or disagreement with the author only by
meeting the author's arguments, not by simply following them.

Some people fail to distinguish between two senses of agreement. In consequence,
they wrongly suppose that where there is understanding between men, disagree mt
is impossible. They all disagreement is simply due misunderstanding. The error
is corrected as soon we remember that the author is making judgments about the
world in which live. Obviously, he can be right or wrong.

You disagree because you think the author can be shown to be wrong on some
point. You are not simply voicing your prejudice or expressing your emotions.

There are three conditions which must be satisfied in order for controversy to
be well conducted / intelligent and profitable conversation.

1. It is necessary to acknowledge emotions to bring to a dispute, or those which
   arise in the course of it. Otherwise, you are likely to be giving vent to
   feelings, not stating reasons.

2. You must make your own assumptions explicit. You must know what your
   prejudices are. Otherwise you are not likely to admit that your opponent may
   be equally entitled to different assumptions.

   Good controversy should not be a quarrel about assumptions. If an author asks
   you to take something for granted, the fact that the opposite can be taken
   for granted should prevent you from honoring his request. If your prejudices
   lie on the opposite side, and if you do not acknowledge them to be
   prejudices, you cannot give the author's case a fair hearing.

3. An attempt at impartiality is a good antidote for the blindness that is
   inevitable in partisanship. Controversy without partisanship is, of course,
   impossible, but to be sure that there is more light in it, and less heat,
   each of the disputants should at least try to take the other fellow's point
   of view. If you have not been able to read a book sympathetically, your
   disagreement with it is probably more contentious than judicial.

Adler think these rules are too hard to actually follow in practice.

Four ways in which a book can be adversely criticized:

Hope is that if a reader confines himself to make these points, he will be less
likely to indulge in expressions of emotion or prejudice.

After he hsaid said, "I understand but I disagree" he can make the following
remarks:

1. You are uninformed

2. You are misinformed

3. You are illogical, your reasoning is not cogent

4. Your analysis is incomplete.

These may not be exhaustive, though I think they are.

They are somewhat independent.

The reader cannot make any of these remarks without being definite and precise
about the respect in which the author is uninformed or misinformed or illogical
(e.g. it cannot be totally illogical).

The reader who makes any of these remarks must not only make it definitely, by
specifying these remarks, but he must always support his point.

The first 3 points deal with the soundness of the author's statements and
reasoning. The fourth deals with the completeness of the author's execution of
his plan-- the adequacy with which he discharges the task he has chosen.

Rule 3.2.1: |rule 3.2.1|
------------------------

To say the author is *uninformed* is to say that he lacks some piece of
knowledge which is *relevant* to the problem he is trying to solve.

Note: Unless the knowledge would have been relevant, there is no point in making
the remark.

To support the remark, you must be able yourself to state the knowledge which
the author lacks and show it is relevant, how it makes a difference to his
conclusions.

Rule 3.2.2: |rule 3.2.2|
------------------------

To say than an author is *misinformed* is to say that he asserts what is not the
case.

His error may be due to lack of knowledge but the error is more than that.

This kind of defect should be pointed out, of course, only if it is relevant to
the author's conclusions.

To support the remark you must be able to argue the truth or greater probability
of a position contrary to the author's.

These first two points of criticism are somewhat related. Lack of information
may be the cause of erroneous assertions. Further, whenever a man is misinformed,
he is also uninformed of the truth. But it makes a differences whether the
defect be simply negative or positive as well. Lack of relevant knowledge makes
it impossible to solve certain problem or support certain conclusions. Erroneous
suppositions, however, lead to wrong conclusions and untenable solutions. Take
together, these two points charge an author with defects in his premises. He
needs more knowledge than he possesses. His evidences and reasons are not good
enough in quantity or quality.

Rule 3.2.3: |rule 3.2.3|
------------------------

To say that an author is *illogical* is to say that he has committed a fallacy in
reasoning.

In general, fallacies are of two sorts.

1. The *non sequitur*, when the conclusion does follow from the premises

2. Inconsistency, when propositions are incompatible

To make either of these criticisms, the author must be able to show the precise
respect in which the author's argument lacks cogency.

One is concerned with this defect only to the extent that major conclusions are
affected by it. A book may lack cogency in irrelevant respects.

This point is related to the first two.

Rule 3.2.4: |rule 3.2.4|
------------------------

Background: Since the reader understands, his failure to support any of these
first three remarks obligates you to agree with the author as far as he has
gone. Since you have not been able to show the author is uninformed,
misinformed, or illogical on relevant matters, you simply cannot disagree. You
must agree.

To say that an author's analysis is *incomplete* is to say that he has not
solved all the problems he started with, or that he has not made as good a use
of his materials as possible, that he did not see all their implications and
ramifications, or that he has failed to make distinctions which are relevant to
his undertaking.

It is not enough to say that a book is incomplete; anyone can say that of any
book. There is no point in making this remark, therefore, unless the reader can
define the inadequacy precisely, either by his own efforts as a knower or
through the help of other books.

This point is strictly not a basis for disagreement.

A reader who agrees with a book in part -- because he finds no reason to make any
of the other points of criticism -- may, nevertheless, suspend judgment on the
whole, in light of the fourth point about the book's incompleteness.

----

Related books in the same field can be critically compared by reference to these
four criteria. One is better than another in proportion as it speaks more truth
and makes fewer errors. If we are reading for knowledge, that book is best which
most adequately treats a given subject matter.

The profoundest comparison is made with respect to the completeness of analysis
which each presents. The measure of such completeness is to be found in the
number of valid and significant distinctions which the accounts being compared
contain.

You may also see how the fourth critical remark ties together the three readings
of any book. The last step in the second reading is to known which of these
problems the author solved and which he did not. The final step of criticism is
the point about completeness. It touches the first reading in so far as it
consider how adequately the author stated his problems, and the second in for as
it measures how satisfactorily he solved them.


----

These rules describe an ideal performance. Few people have ever ready any book
in this ideal manner. And those who have probably ready very few book sin this
way. The ideal remains, however, the measure of achievement. You are a good
reader in the degree to which you approximate it

When we speak of someone as "well read" we should have this ideal in mind. Too
often, I fear, we use the phrase to mean the quantity rather than than the
quality of reading. A person who has read widely but not well deserves to be
pitied rather than praised, for so much effort has been misguided and
profitless.

The great writers have always been great readers, but that does not mean they
they read *all* the great books which, in their day, were listed as the great
and indispensable ones. In many cases, they read fewer books than are now
required in some of out better colleges, but what they did read, they read well.

There are of course many books worth reading well. There is a much larger number
which should be only scanned and skimmed.

.. _chapter 14:

************************
And still more rules
************************

:Pages: 266-291 (25)

There are a few point to make about the utility of looking outside the book you
are reading in order to read it well.

In any art, rules have a disappointing way of being too general. The more
general, the fewer, but also the more remote they are from the intricacies  of
the actual situation in which you try to follow them.

So far the rules have been stated generally enough to apply to any instructive
book, but you cannot read a book in general.

The most important thing about any practical book is that it can never solve the
practical problems with which it is concerned. Action is required. This is in
contrast to a theoretical book, which can solve its own problems.

Every action takes place in a particular situation under special circumstances.
You cannot act in general. The kind of practical judgment which immediately
precedes action must be highly particular.

A book rarely will give such concrete advice, so rarely is such advice is every
written. Only someone in the same exact situation could help.

Practical books fall into two main groups. Those the primarily present rules (of
which, no great books are) and those that are primarily concerned with the
principles which generate rules (e.g. great books in economics, politics, and
morals).

In reading a book which is primarily a rulebook, the major propositions too look
for, of course, are the rules. You can always recognize a rule because it
recommend something as worth doing to gain a certain end. The arguments in a
practical book will be attempts to show you that the rules are sound. The writer
may appeal to principles or simply illustrate their soundness by showing how
they work in on concrete cases. The former is less persuasive, but it can
explain the reason for the rules better than examples of their use can.

In the other kind, the major of propositions and arguments will look exactly
like those in a purely theoretical book. The propositions will say that
something is the case, and the arguments will try to show that it is so.
However, there is an important difference between reading a such a book and a
purely theoreitcal one- since ultimate problems to be solved are practical, an
intelligent reader always readings between the lines and see the rules which may
not be expressed, but may be derived from the general principles. Unless it is
so read, a practical book is not read as practical, and is read poorly. You
really do not understand it, and certainly cannot criticize it properly in any
other way.

In judging a theoretic book, the reader must observe the discrepancy between his
own basic assumptions and those of the author. In judging a partical book,
everything turns on the ends or goals, not the means.

Two clues to the major questions you must ask about yourself in reading any sort
of practical book:

1. What are the author's objectives?
2. What means is he proposing?

Answering both of these is necessary for the understanding and criticism of a
practical book.

Since the ultimate judgment of a practical work is based on its ends, the author
must be something of an orator or propagandist. There is nothing wrong or
vicious about this; it is the nature of practical affairs. No one makes serious
practical judgments or engages in action without being moved somehow from below
the neck. The writer of practical books who does not realize this will be
ineffective.

.. 274 todo: resume at "The best protection..."

.. 280 - Extrinsic reading scientific work

Scientific work
    The report of findings or conclusions in some field of research, whether
    carried on experimentally in a laboratory or by observations of nature in
    the raw.

The scientific problem is always to describe the phenomena as accurately as
possible and to trace the interconnections among different kinds of phenomena.

In the great works of science, there is no oratory or propaganda, though there
may be bias in the sense of initial presuppositions. You can detect this by
distinguishing what the author assumes from what he establishes through
argument. The more objective a scientific author is, the more he will explicitly
beg you to take this or that for granted. Scientific objectivity is not the
absence of initial bias; it is attained by a frank confession of it.

The leading terms in a scientific work are usually expressed by uncommon or
technical words. They are relatively easy to spot. Through them you can readily
grasp the propositions. The main propositions are always general ones, since
science tries to say how things are generally.

The only point of difficulty is with respect to arguments. Science is primarily
inductive. To understand and judge the inductive arguments in a scientific book,
you must be able to follow the evidence which the scientists reports as their
basis. Sometimes descriptions or diagrams illustrate the phenomena. In the worst
case the reader must get the special experience for himself first hand (perhaps
at a museum). This is reason why a good school would require laboratory work for
students.

> The scientific classics become more intelligible to those who have seen with
their own eyes and done with their own hands what a great scientist describes as
as the procedure by which he reached his insights.

**Thus, the major extrinsic aid in the read of scientific books is not the
reading of other books, but rather getting a direct acquaintance with the
phenomena involved.**

Other books may be helpful, but the primary aid is experiment.

.. 282 - Philosophical

Ethical and political books have already been treated. (practical philosophy)

Here we treat theoretic works, such as metaphysics.

The philosophical problem is to explain, not to describe, the nature of things.
It asks more about the connection of phenomena. It seeks to penetrate to the
ultimate causes and conditions of things.

The basic terms of philosophy and science are abstract. No general knowledge is
expressible except in abstract terms. Whenever you talk generally about anything
you are using abstractions.

Just as the inductive argument should be the reader's main focus in the case of
scientific books, so here you must pay closest attention to the philosopher's
principles or beginnings.

.. todo: skipped a lot to 286

There are two further points about extrinsic reading in connection with
philosophical books:

1. Do not spend all your time reading books about the philosophers, their lives,
   and opinions. Trying reading the philosophers themselves, in relation to one
   another.

2. Note the data of the philosopher you are reading. This will place his
   properly in the conversation with those who cam before and after, and prper
   you for the sort of scientific imagery he will employ to illustrate some of
   his points.

.. 288 - Summary

Summary:

What lies beyond the book you are reading? Three things:

1. Experience, common or special

2. Other books (of various sorts: reference books, secondary books,
   commentaries, other great books, dealing with the same or related matters)

3. Live discussion

    > I like to think of the great books as involved in a prolonged conversation
    about the basic problems of mankind. The great authors were great readers,
    and one way to understand them is to read the books they read. As readers,
    they carried on a conversation with other authors, just as each of us
    carries on a conversation with the books we read, though we may not write
    other books.

    To get into conversations, we must read the great books in relation to each
    other and in an order that somehow respects chronology. The conversation of
    the books takes place in time.

    While this is not indispensable, it is certainly a great help. Hence, why
    teachers meet with students to discuss them. The reader who learns to
    discuss a book well with other with other readers may come thereby to have
    better conversations with the author when he has him alone in his study.

Following all the rules of intrinsic reading is seldom sufficient to read any
book well, either interpretatively or critically. Experience and other books
are dispensable extrinsic aids.

The utility of extrinsic reading is simply an extension of the value of context
in read a book by itself. We have seen how the context must be used to interpret
words and sentences to find terms and propositions. Just as the whole book is a
context for any of its parts, so related books provide an even larger context
that helps you interpret the ones you are reading.

----

Mortimer Adler wrote the book on reading in "How to Read a Book". Identified four levels of reading:

1.  Elementary

    The level of reading taught in our elementary schools.

2.  Inspectional

    Inspectional reading allows us to look at the authors blueprint and evaluate
    the merits of a deeper reading experience

    There are two types of inspectional reading:

    1.  Systematic skimming

        This is meant to be a quick check of the book by:

        1.  Reading the preface
        2.  Studying the table of contents
        3.  Checking the index
        4.  Reading the inside jacket

        This should give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in
        the book pivotal to the authors argument.

        Skimming helps you reach a decision point: Does this book deserve more
        of my time and attention?

    2.  Superficial reading

3.  Analytical

    Analytical reading is a thorough reading; the best you can do given an
    unlimited time.

    Rules to analytic reading:

    -   Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
    -   State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity
    -   Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole
    -   Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve

    Though these may sound easy, they involve a lot of work.

    When you're done this, you may understand the book but not the broader
    subject. To do this, you need to use comparative reading to synthesize
    knowledge from several books on the same subject.

4.  Syntopical

    This is also known as comparative reading and it represents the most
    demanding and difficult reading of all.

    Syntopical reading involves reading many books on the same subject and
    comparing and contrasting ideas.

    There are five steps to syntopical reading:

    1. Find the relevant passages
    2. Bring the author to terms
    3. Get the questions clear
    4. Define the issues
    5. Analyze the discussion

These are thought of as levels because you can't move to a higher level without
a firm understanding of the previous one.

The goal of reading determines how you read. The goal of reading a romance novel
is different from reading the newspaper which is different from reading Plato.

.. _active reading:

Active reading
    The kind of reading we do when we read anything which requires effort to
    understand.
       
    Active readings entails a variety of activity and skill in the performance
    of the various acts required.

    See also: `Passive reading`_.

.. _criticism:

Criticism
    To judge whether what is being offered is really acceptable as knowledge

.. 186
.. _communication:

Communication
    An effort on the part of one man to share some with another: his knowledge,
    his decisions, his sentiments.

    Root is related to the word "common".
    
    Communication succeeds only when it results in a common something, as an
    item of knowledge which two men have in common. When there is unresolved
    ambiguity in communication, there is no communication, or at best it must be
    incomplete.
   
    Successful communication occurs in any case where what the writer wanted to
    have received finds its way into the reader's possession. The writer's and
    reader's skill converge upon a common end.

    For communication to be successful, it is necessary for two parties to use
    the same words with the same meanings.

.. _complex skill:
.. _complex skills:

Complex skill
    A skill_ which depends on many other simpler skills in order to be performed
    effectively.

    During the acquisition of a complex skill, each of its component skills
    must be done separately and consciously, but they can be done together
    and unconsciously when we are expert.

    *example* tennis, driving a car, reading

.. _complexity:

Complexity
    The parts and organization of parts of a complex entity.

.. _extrinsic:
.. _extrinsic reading:

Extrinsic reading
    Reading a book in the light of other books.

    Other books may be only reference books, secondary books or other great
    books.

    We may also necessarily use relevant experience as an extrinsic aid.

.. 143
.. _front matter:

Front matter
    The front matter consists of:

    - the title
    - the subtitle
    - table of contents
    - preface


.. _history:

History
    History is knowledge of particular events or things which not only existed
    in the past, but underwent a series of changes in the course of time.

    The historian narrates these happenings and often colors his narrative
    with some comment on, or insight into, the significance of the events.

.. _information:

Information
    Information refers to facts or knowing *that*. One can test for information
    by testing recall.

    Information is a prerequisite for understanding_.


.. 129
.. _intrinsic:
.. _intrinsic reading:

Intrinsic reading
    Reading a book in itself, apart from all other books.

.. _learning_curve:

Learning curve
    A graphical representation of a person's skill versus their experience,
    which is typically curved due to improvement in skill becoming harder as
    experience increases.

.. _learning_plateau:

Learning plateau
    A span of time in which a learner's skill remains constant despite
    additional experienced.
    
    Learning plateaus are not found in all learning curves, but only in those
    which record progress in gaining a `complex skill`_. The more complex the
    skill, the more frequently learning plateaus appear.

    Learning goes on during learning plateaus, but it does not manifest as
    an improvement in skill.
    
    One explanation is that during a learning plateau the learner combines
    simple acts into a complex one, and only when he has mastered the complex
    act does his skill visibly improve. Thus, in order to perform a complex act
    (like reading or playing tennis) one needs to master each of its component 
    acts (such that they become automatic), and then master them in
    combination. (One cannot think about beating one's opponent in tennis
    until one can reliably return a ball.)

.. _obscurantism:

Obscurantism
    The error of supposing that all books can be read in only one way.

    There are two extremes:

    1.  Of estheticism, which regards all books as if they were poetry
    2.  Of intellectualism, which treats all books as if they were instructive

.. _passive:
.. _passive reading:

Passive reading
    The kind of reading_ we do when we read anything which is immediately
    comprehensible to us.

    We tend to think of reading almost as if it were something as simple and
    natural to do as looking or walking. There is no art of looking or walking.

Practical Book
    A book concerned with `action`, `applied science`, or `knowing how` to do
    something which you think you `should`.


.. _purism:

Purism
    The error of supposing that a given book can be read in only one way.

    It is an error because books are not pure in character, and that in turn
    is due to the fact that the human mind, which writes or reads them, is
    rooted in the senses and imagination and moves or is moved by emotion
    and sentiment.


.. _read for information:
.. _reading for information:

Reading for information
    Passive_ `reading for instruction`_ for gaining information_ (e.g.
    newspapers, magazines).   

    Reading for information makes up the majority of time reading and is the
    only kind lesser readers can do.

    Reading for information is the only kind of reading require by most schools.

.. _read for understanding:
.. _reading for understanding:

Reading for understanding
    Active_ `reading for instruction`_ for gaining understanding_.

    There are two conditions under which reading for understanding takes place:

    1. Initially, the writer understands_ more than the reader, and is
       communicating something which can increase the reader's understanding.
       (If the writer does understand more than we do, we can only be informed
       by him.)

    2. The reader is able to overcome this inequality to some degree and
       approach equality with the writer.

.. _science:

Science
    Science treat of matters that can happen at any time or place.

    Scientists seek laws or generalizations.

    Scientists seek to find out how things happen for the most part or in
    ever case.

    The rules of extrinsic reading are more complicated in the case of scientific
    books. You may actually have have to witness an experiment unless you can use
    your imagination to construct something as you have never observed.

Skill
    Knowledge *how*; the ability to perform some particular act.
    
    A person who has a skill can do things that people who lack the skill
    cannot.

    In many fields we measure a man's skill_ by the difficulty of the task he
    can perform.

    Skills must be learned through practice.

Term
    A word used unambiguously.

    All (or at least nearly all) words are ambiguous, but a word which has
    several meanings can be used in one sense at a time.

    Terms do not appear in dictionaries, though the materials for making them
    are there. Terms occur only in the process of communication.
    
    Terms are basic elements of communicable knowledge.

    A term is not a word. A word may be ambiguous, especially an important word.

Understanding
    To understand is to learn not only facts but their significance; to know
    that something is the case and to know why it is the case; to be able to
    explain something.

    To understand is to grasp what is being offered as knowledge

    To understand some thing, one must approach it:

    1. As a whole, having unity and a structure of parts
    2. In terms of its elements, its units of language and thought

.. [7]
    One obvious fact shows the existence of a wide range of degrees in the
    ability to read is that reading begins in the primary grades and runs
    through every level of the educational system. Since what we have to learn,
    as we ascend in our education, becomes more difficult or complex, we must
    improve our ability to read proportionately.

    Supposedly, gradations in reading go along with graduations from one
    educational level to another. This supposition is not well founded, however,
    as in the US, there is little discernible difference between the literacy of
    a high school student and a college senior. But, this fact means only that
    the gradations have become more obscure for us, not that they do not exist.

.. [8]
    The accuracy of such measurement depends, of course, on the independent
    precision with which we can grade the tasks in difficulty. We would be
    moving in circles if we said, for instance, that the more difficult book is
    one which only the better reader can master.

    In order to understand what makes some books more difficult to read than
    others, we would have to know what demands they make on the skill of the
    reader.

    The difficulty of the reading matter is a convenient, objective sign of
    degrees of reading ability, but it does not tell us what the difference is
    in that reader, so far as his skill is concerned.

.. [9]
    You may have some reservations about the enterprise:

    - There are many books other than the `great books`_ which are worth
      reading. But we must admit the better the book, the more it is worth
      reading. Furthermore, if you learn how to read the great books, you will
      have no difficulty in reading anything else.

.. [11]
    Adler tells a story:

    Here is a book, I said, and here is your mind. The book consists of language
    written by someone for the sake of communicating something to you. Your
    success in reading is determined by the extent to which you get all that
    writer intended to communicate.

    Now, as you go through the pages either you understand perfectly everything
    the author has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained
    information, but you could not have increased understand. If upon effortless
    inspection, a book is completely intelligible to you, then the author and
    you are as two minds in the same mold. The symbols on the page merely
    express the common understanding your had before you met.

    Let us take the second alternative. You do not understand the book perfectly
    at once. Let us assume even that you understand enough to know you do not
    understand it all. You know there is more in the book than you understand
    and hence, that the book contains something which can increase your
    understanding. What do you do then?

    You can do a number of things.

    You can take the book to someone else who, you think, can read better than
    you, and have him explain the parts that troubled you.

    Or you can get him to recommend a textbook or commentary which will make it
    all plain by telling you what the author meant.

    Or you may decide, as many students do, that what's over your head isn't
    worth bothering about, that you understand enough, and the rest doesn't
    matter.

    If you do any of these things, you are not doing the job of reading which
    the book requires. That is done in one way only. Without external help, you
    take the book into your study and work on it. With nothing but the power of
    your mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that you
    gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of
    understanding more.

    Such elevation, accomplished by the mind working on a book, is reading, the
    kind of reading that a book which challenges your understanding deserves.

    Thus I roughly defined what I mean by reading: the process whereby a mind,
    with nothing to operate on the but the symbols of readable matter, and with
    not help from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations.
    The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more.

    The operations which causes this to happen are the various acts which
    constitute the art of reading. "How many of these acts do you know?" I asked
    three thousand teachers. "What things would you do by yourself if your lif
    depended on understanding something readable which at first perusal left you
    somewhat in the dark?"

.. [12]
    One thing is clear. Knowing the rules of an art is not the same as having the
    habit. When we speak of a man as skilled in any way, we do not mean that he
    knows the rules of doing something, but that he possesses the habit of doing it.

    Of course, it is true that knowing the rules, more or less explicitly, is a
    condition of getting the skill. Nor can you acquire an artistic habit without
    following rules. The art as something which can be taught consists of rules to
    be followed in operation.

.. [13]
    It is not entirely humbug, because we usually know a little more and can do
    a little better than our best students.

.. [14]
    Nevertheless, many ignorant people make this mistake, mistaking quantity of
    reading for quality of reading.  (We call these people sophomores meaning
    "wise fools".)


.. [15]
    Some, but not all learning can be achieved through reading: we can learn
    knowledge *that* through reading but not skill. At best a book can aid one
    can learn the nature of an art and its rules. No book can direct you in the
    acquisition of a skill with as much efficiency as the tutor or coach who

    Unlike a `dead teacher`_, a live teacher may teach us skills_ by *showing*
    us how or helping us directly go through the motions. Without a live
    teacher, we have to develop skill by practicing according to rules in a
    book, without being stopped, corrected, and shown how. (Though it certainly
    can be done.) takes you by the hand and leads you through the motions.

.. [16]
    They need not be original in entirety of course. On the contrary, complete
    originality is both impossible and misleading. It is impossible except at
    the hypothetical beginning of cultural tradition. It is misleading because
    no one should try to discover for himself what he can be taught by others.
    The best sort of originality is that which adds something to the fund of
    knowledge made available by the tradition of learning. Ignorance or neglect
    of the tradition is likely to result in a false or shallow originality.

.. [17]
    As arts, grammar and logic are concerned with language in relation to
    thought and thought in relation to language. That is why I said earlier that
    skill in reading and writing is gained through these liberal arts,
    especially grammar and logic.

.. todo: where? that is an interesting argument

.. 135
.. [18]
    Books which treat of the appreciation or criticism of `fine art`_ are
    themselves `liberal arts`_. [#]_ After reading this book you can read those
    and learn how to read the other way. In general, you will find the greatest
    help from those books which formulate the rules and exemplify them in
    practice. [#]_

.. [19]
    The process of translation from a foreign language into English is relevant
    to the test I have suggested. If you cannot state in an English sentence
    what a French sentence says, you know you do not understand the meaning of
    the French.

.. [20]
    Not all propositions are equally susceptible to this test. It may be
    necessary to have the special experience which only a laboratory can afford
    to be sure you have grasped certain scientific propositions.

**Relation to thinking**

Thinking is only one part of the activity of learning.

I stress again the two errors which are so frequently made:

1. Believing that the art of thinking could be by itself.
   
   Since we never think apart from the work of being taught or the
   process of research, there is no art of thinking apart from the art of
   reading and listening, on the one hand, the art of discovery on the other.

2. Believing that the art of thinking is the same as the art of discovery.

   It is equally important to know how we think when we read a book or listen to
   a lecture. Perhaps it is even more important for teachers who are engaged in
   instruction, since the art of reading must be related to the art of being
   taught, as the art of writing is related to the art of reading. I doubt
   whether anyone who does not know to read well can write well. I similarly
   doubt whether anyone who does have the art of being taught is skilled in
   teach.

The cause of these errors is probably complex.

- Partly, they may be due to the false supposition that teaching and research
  are active_, whereas reading being taught are merely passive_.

- Partly, they may be due to an exaggeration of the scientific method, which
  stresses discovery_ as if it were the only occasion for thought.

We neither agree nor disagree with nature, as we often do the case of books. The
critical faculty need to employed only in the latter case.

----

- Skill (or art or *knowing-how*) is acquired by practice.

- Theory (or *knowing-that*) is acquired by discovery_ or instruction_.

**Practice** is the process of learning an art or skill by both learning its
rules and forming the habits of operating according them. [12]_ Certain
intellectual arts (such as writing, research, and musical composition), require
also understanding the theory behind the rules.


----

When avoid effort in learning, we find ourselves with the results of
effortless learning: assorted vagaries we collect by letting secondary
teachers indoctrinate us. If you paid the greater price in effort, you would
be rewarded by better goods.

.. note: the above paragraph is interesting as a response to Clara's notion that
     a good artist makes them approachable to anyone. It is simply untrue.

----

Secondary teachers usually simplify topics for unskilled readers,
often coming off as authorities when in fact they are simply better students.
The primary sources of his own knowledge should be the primary sources of
learning for his students.

----

Considered as a source of knowledge, live teachers either compete with or
cooperate with `dead teachers`_.

- By competition, I mean the way in which many live teachers tell their
  students by lectures what the students could learn by reading the books
  the lecturer himself digested. (Long before the magazine existed, live
  teachers earned their living by being "reader's digests".
  
- By cooperations I mean the way in which the live teacher somehow divides
  the function of teaching between himself and the available books: some
  things he tells the students and some things he expects the student to
  learn by reading.

If these were the only functions a live teacher performed, it would follow
that anything which can be learned in school can be learned outside of
school and without live teachers. (It might take a little more trouble to
read for yourself than to have books digested for you. You might have to
read more books, if books were your only teachers. But to whatever extent it
is true that the live teacher has no knowledge to communicate except he
himself learned by reading, you can learn it directly from books yourself,
provided you can read as well.) Moreover, if you seek is understanding
rather than information, reading will take you further. Most people are even
more likely to be passive in listening to a lecture than reading a book.
Note-taking is usually not an active assimilation of what is to be
understood, but an almost automatic record of what was said.

There are two other functions a live teacher performs, by which he relates
to books.

1. Repetition. This is not really useful though, because if a student had
   read the assigned text he would have gotten what he wanted anyway, and if
   he was unable to, he would be less likely to be able to understand the
   lecture.

2. Original communication. This used to be more common before printing.
   Students would travel all over Europe to hear a famous lecturer. This
   function is uncommon today. Few teachers have original communications to
   make (most simply repeat or digest, and students could learn everything
   he knows by reading the books he has read).

-----

**Degrees of reading ability**

The art of reading is the skill of receiving written communication as well as
possible. As a skill, there are various degrees of reading ability.

Reading is a complex activity, just as writing is. It consists of a large number
of separate acts, all of which must be performed in a good reading. The person
who can perform more of them is better able to read.

Here we distinguish what it means to read "better" or "worse": [7]_ 

1. One reader is better than another if he can read more *difficult material*.
   [8]_
   
2. Given the same thing to read, one reader is better than another insofar as he
   reads more actively_ and performs each of the acts involved more
   successfully.

3. One reader is better than another in proportion as he is capable of a greater
   range of activity in reading. This includes both being able to read `great
   books`_ and being able to read lesser books which may inadvertently hamper
   the reader.

4. One reader is better than another if can receive everything the author wished
   to communicate more completely.

**Great books**

The `great books`_ in all fields of learning are original communications.

A great book is 

Great books are usually called "classics", but that word has for most people a
wrong and forbidding connotation -- wrong in the sense of referring to
antiquity, and forbidding in the sense of sounding unreadable. Great books are
being written today and were written yesterday as well as long ago, and far from
being unreadable, the great books are the most readable and those which most
deserve to be read.

Only after you have read some of the great books competently will you have an
intimate grasp of the standards by which other books can be judged as great or
good.

Great books are like popularizations in that most of them are written for
ordinary men and not for pedants of scholars. To the extent that they are
original, they have to address themselves to an audience which starts from
scratch. However, unlike textbooks and popularizations, the great books assume
an audience of readers who are thoroughly competent to read.

Great books are the most readable. In some cases, of course, they are difficult
to read. They require the greatest ability to read. The art of teaching demands
a corresponding and proportionate art of being taught. But, at the same time the
great books are the most competent to instruct us about the subject matters with
which they deal. If we had the skill necessary to read them, we would find them
the easiest.

There is something of a paradox here. It is due to the fact that two different
kinds of mastery are involved. There is, on the one hand, the author's mastery
of his subject matter; on the other, there is our need to master the book he has
written. These books are recognized as great because of their mastery, and we
rate ourselves as reader according to the degree of our ability to master these
books.

If our aim in reading is to gain knowledge and insight, then the great books are
the most readable, both for the less and for the more competent, because they
are the most instructive. Obviously, I do not mean "most readable" in the sense
of "with the least effort" -- even for the expert reader. I mean that these
books reward every degree of effort and ability to the maximum. It maybe hard
to dig for gold than for potatoes, but each unit of successful effort is more
amply repaid.

----

Perhaps you are beginning to see how essential a part of reading it is to be
perplexed and know it. Wonder is the beginning of wisdom in learning from books
as well as from nature.

.. I disagree with the above *as a necessary fact*.
