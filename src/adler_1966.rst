:Abstract:
    This book has only two functions to perform: to interest you in the profit
    of reading and to assist you in cultivating the art.

    This book is intended to help you develop the `art`_ of `reading for
    understanding`_, not `reading for information`; therefore, it aims to
    encourage and assist you in reading the `great books`_.

The activity of reading
#################################################################################

.. This abstract was taken from page 166

:Abstract:
    This part is about the nature of reading in general, the various kinds of
    reading, and the relation of the art of reading ot the art of being taught
    in school and out. It considers, therefore, the serious consequences of the
    neglect of reading in contemporary education, suggesting as a solution that
    books can be substituted for living teachers if individuals can help
    themselves learn how to read.

.. 175

Adler analyzes this part as such:

    The book is divided into three major parts.

    1. The first treats of the nature and kinds of reading, and the place of
       reading in education.

       This part is divided into the following sections.

       1. The varieties and degrees of reading ability.

       2. The major distinctions between `reading for amusement`_ and `reading
          for instruction`_.

       3. The distinction, in `reading for instruction`_, between `reading for
          information`_ and `reading for understanding`_.

       4. The relation of this last distinction to one between `active reading`_
          and `passive reading`_.

       5. Defines the sort of reading to be discussed as the reception of
          communications conveying knowledge.

       6. Relates reading to learning_, by distinguishing between learning by
          discovery_ and learning by instruction_.

       7. The relation of books and teachers, distinguishing them as dead and
          alive, and shows that reading is learning from dead teachers.

       8. Distinguishes between `primary teachers`_ and `secondary teachers`_,
          living or dead, and defines the great books as original
          communications, and hence primary teachers.

    2. The second treats of the failure of contemporary education with respect
       to reading.

       This part is divided into the following sections.

       1. The varieties and degrees of reading ability.
       2. The relation of reading to such other skills as writing and speaking
          are discussed with respect to current educational defects.
       3. The results of scientific educational measurements are reported to
          show the lack of these skills in the graduates of our schools.
       4. Other evidences, especially from book publishers, are offered as
          correlating evidence to these findings.
       5. An attempt is made to explain why the schools have failed.

    3. The third attempts to show how the contemporary education situation can
       be remedied.

       1. Any art of skill can be acquired by those who will practice according
          to the rules.
       2. It is indicated how the art of reading might be acquired by those who
          did not learn how in school.
       3. It is suggested that by learning how to read, people can compensate
          for the defects of their education.
       4. It is hoped that if people generally understood what an education
          should be, through having learned to read and having read, they would
          take serious steps to reform the failing school system.

This is a book for readers who cannot read.

There are many kinds of reading and degrees of ability to read.

This book is for readers who want to read better or want to read in some other
way than they now can.

This book is for people who cannot read at all (e.g. infants, imbeciles) and
masters. 

    Most of us know that we are are not expert reader. We know this in many
    ways, but most obviously when we find some things too difficult to read, or
    have great trouble in reading them; or when someone else has read the same
    thing we have and shown us how much we missed or misunderstood...  Most of
    us have experienced difficulties in reading, but we do not know why we have
    trouble or what to do about it.

    I think this is because most of us do not regard reading as a complicated
    activity, involving many different steps in each of which we can acquire
    more and more skill through practice, as in the case of any other art. We
    may not even think there is an art of reading. We tend to think of reading
    almost as if it were something as simple and natural to do as looking or
    walking. There is no art of looking or walking. 


    I told him that this book was like a book on how to play tennis.

    As written about in books, the art of tennis consists of rules for making
    each of the various strokes, a discussion of how and when to use them, and a
    description of how to organize these parts into the general strategy of a
    successful game. The art of reading has to be written about in the same way.
    There are rules for each of the different steps you must take to complete
    the reading of a whole book.

Knowing how to read well was like any other art or skill.

    For every illusion that the classroom can nourish, there is a school  of
    hard knocks to destroy it.

    Here I wish only to record this fact about our schools, a fact which
    concerns us all, because in large part they have made us what we are
    todaypeople who cannot read well enough to enjoy reading for profit or
    profit by reading for enjoyment. (11)

    But education does not stop with schooling, nor does the responsibility for
    the ultimate educational fate of each of us rest entirely on the school
    system. Everyone can and must decide for himself whether he is satisfied
    with the education he got, or is now getting if he is still in school. If he
    is not satisfied, it is up to him to do something about it. With schools as
    they are, more schooling is hardly the remedy. One way outperhaps the only
    one available to most peopleis to learn to read better, and then, by
    reading better, to learn more of what can be learned through reading. (11)

The reading of "reading" & Reading is learning
********************************************************************************
:Pages: 16-33, 33-48

:Abstract:
    In these chapters we define what we mean by "reading". There are different
    degrees of reading and different kinds of reading. The different kinds of
    reading are reading for information and reading for understanding.

    Some, but not all, reading is learning (e.g. amusement). Some, but not all,
    learning is reading (e.g. skills or discovery).

1. The varieties and `degrees of reading`_ ability.

2. The major distinctions between `reading for amusement`_ and `reading for
   instruction`_.

3. The distinction, in `reading for instruction`_, between `information`_ and
   `understanding`_.

4. The relation of this last distinction to one between `active reading`_ and
   `passive reading`_.

5. Defines the sort of reading to be discussed as the reception of
   communications conveying knowledge.

6. Relates reading to learning_, by distinguishing between learning by
   discovery_ and learning by instruction_.

7. The relation of books and teachers, distinguishing them as dead and alive,
   and shows that reading is learning from dead teachers.

8. Distinguishes between primary and secondary teachers, living or dead, and
   defines the great books as `original communications`_, and hence primary
   teachers.

Degrees of reading
================================================================================

Here we distinguish what it means to read "better" or "worse": [7]_ 

1. One reader is better than another another if he can read more *difficult
   material*. [8]_
   
2. Given the same thing to read, one reader is better than another insofar as
   he reads more actively_ and performs each of the acts involved more
   successfully.

3. One reader is better than another in proportion as he is capable of a greater
   range of activity in reading. This includes both being able to read `great
   books`_ and being able to read lesser books which may inadvertently hamper
   the reader.

Reading appropriately
================================================================================

Different kinds of reading are appropriate to different kinds of literature.

`Great books` deserve `reading for understanding`_. To only `read for
information`_ with these books is a great waste. Nevertheless, many ignorant
people make this mistake, mistaking quantity of reading for quality of reading.
(We call these people sophomores meaning "wise fools".)

Note, it is possible to be mistaken in your judgment of something you're
reading. So, the beginning of reading as a conscious effort to understand is an
accurate perception of the difference.

Relation to thinking
================================================================================

Thinking is only one part of the activity of learning.

I stress again the two errors which are so frequently made:

1. Made by those who write or talk about an art of thinking as if there were any
   such thing in and by itself. Since we never thinking apart from the work of
   being taught or the process of research, there is no art of thinking apart
   from the art of reading and listening, on the one hand, the art of discovery
   on the other. To whatever extent it is true that reading is learning, it is
   also true that reading is thinking. A complete account of the art of thinking
   can be given only in the context of a complete analysis of reading and
   research.

2. Made by those who write about the art of thinking as if it were identical
   with the art of discovery.

   It is equally important to know how we think when we read a book or listen to
   a lecture. Perhaps it is even more important for teachers who are engaged in
   instruction, since the art of reading must be related to the art of being
   taught, as the art of writing is related to the art of reading. I doubt
   whether anyone who does not know to read well can write well. I similarly
   doubt whether anyone who does have the art of being taught is skilled in
   teach.

The cause of these errors is probably complex.

- Partly, they may be due to the false supposition that teaching and research
  are activities, whereas reading being taught are merely passive.

- Partly, they may be due to an exaggeration of the scientific method, which
  stresses investigation or research as if it were the only occasion for
  thought.
  

The effect of these errors on American education is only too obvious:

- Much more time is spent on training students how to discover things for
  themselves than in training them how to learn from others.

(A balanced education must place a just emphasis on both types of learning and
on the arts they require. There is no particular virtue in wasting time to find
out for yourself what has already been discovered. One should save one's skill
in research for what has not yet been been discovered, and exercise one's skill
in being taught for learning what others already know and therefore can teach.
Each generation of men should not have to learn everything for themselves, as
nothing had ever learned before.)

    We may continue to gain some knowledge by speaking to nature, for it will
    always answer, but there is no point in our ancestors speaking to us unless
    we know how to listen.

We neither agree nor disagree with nature, as we often do the case of books. The
critical faculty need to employed only in the latter case.

----

There is good reason for placing our discussion to the art of reading; listening
is learning from a living teacher, while reading is learning from a dead one (or
at least one who is not present to us except through his writing).

If you ask a living teacher a question, he may answer you. If you are puzzled by
what he says, you may save yourself the trouble of thinking by asking him what
he means. If, however you ask a book, you must answer it yourself. In this
respect a book is like nature. When you speak to it, it answers you only to the
extent that you do the work of thinking and analysis yourself.

Books can also be read under the guidance and with the help of teachers. So we
must consider the relation between books and teachers -- between being taught by
books with and without the aid of teachers. Obviously it is a matter which
concerns those of us who are still in school. But it also concerns those of us
who are not, for we may have to depend on books alone as the means for
continuing our education, and we ought to know how to make books teach us well.

Let me end this chapter by calling you attention to two things.

1. You have learned something about the rules of reading.

2. We have now pretty well defined the purpose of this book.

You may have some reservations about the enterprise:

- There are many books other than the `great books`_ which are worth reading.
  But we must admit the better the book, the more it is worth reading.
  Furthermore, if you learn how to read the great books, you will have no
  difficulty in reading anything else.

From many rules to one habit
****************************

:Abstract: 
    Reading is a `complex skill`_.

    Reading is either intrinsic_ or extrinsic_.
    
    Intrinsic reading consists of understanding_ and criticism_.

    Understanding_ consists of analysis and synthesis.

Three ways of reading
================================================================================

.. 124

A good book deserves three readings.

1.  Understanding_

    1. Analytic Reading
    2. Synthetic Reading

2.  Critical

    3. Critical Reading

These three readings are not three in time, but three in manner: three ways of
reading a book.

The first two readings are `reading for understanding`_. As a reader becomes
expert, these may be performed simultaneously. The third is distinct, as a
reader must understand an author before criticizing him.

The first two readings and the third must be done somewhat separately;
understanding the author must always precede criticizing or judging him.

.. 126

    If you had to check your reading of a book, you would have to divide the
    whole process into its parts. You might have to re-examine separately each
    step you took, though at the time you did not take it separately, so
    habitual had the process of reading become.

.. 127

    The teacher of English composition, going over a paper with a student and
    explaining his marks, points to this or that rule the student violated. At
    that time, the student must be reminded of the different rules, but the
    teacher does not want him to write with a rule sheet before him. He wants
    him to write well habitually, as if the rules were part of his nature. The
    same is true of reading.

Reading 1: |reading 1|
----------------------

Here the reader proceeds from the whole to its parts.

Rules for the first reading:

#. |rule 1.1|_
#. |rule 1.2|_
#. |rule 1.3|_
#. |rule 1.4|_

Knowing `what the whole book is about <rule 1.2_>`_ and `what its main
divisions are <rule 1.3_>`_ will help you discover its leading terms and
propositions. If you can discover what the chief contentions of the author are
and how he supports these by arguments and evidence, you will be aided in

Reading 2: |reading 2|

Here the reader proceeds from the parts to the whole.

The reader focuses on terms, propositions, and syllogisms; the author's ideas,
assertions, and arguments.

Reading 3: |reading 3|

Here the reader judges the author, and decides whether he agrees or disagrees.

.. At this point we have seen rules 1.1, 

Intrinsic reading & Extrinsic reading
=====================================

We distinguish between:

#. `intrinsic reading`_
#. `extrinsic reading`_

.. 127

Rule 0:
    |rule 0|

If authors are agreeing or disagreeing, one cannot be assured one understands
one of them unless they recognize such agreements and disagreements.

This applies especially to the `great books`_-- many of them are
difficult to read because they are related and have been written in a certain
order, such that reading earlier books may help understanding later books.

*see* `chapter 14`_

Rules of `extrinsic reading`_:

1.  Read related books in relation to each other and in an order which renders
    the later ones more intelligible


Criteria for rules of intrinsic reading
=======================================

1. The rules of intrinsic reading also apply to lectures
2. The rules only apply to reading a `whole` book, not to excerpts
3. The rules only apply to liberal arts, not fine arts

.. 129

The rules of intrinsic reading also apply to lectures
------------------------------------------------------

The rules of `intrinsic reading`_ apply equally to reading a book and to taking
a course of lectures.

Lectures require more expertise from users to be profitable:

-   Lectures require a greater exercise of memory or note taking than books
-   Books may be reexamined


.. 130

The rules only apply to reading a `whole` book, not to excerpts
---------------------------------------------------------------

The primary aim of these rules is to help you read a whole book; they would be
misused if applied mainly to excepts or small parts out of context.

One should not read small pieces spaced over time:

- Excerpts are far too short for a sustained effort of reading.
- The order in which excerpts are read make it impossible to grasp and real
  whole concept in itself or to understand one thing in relation to another.

.. TODO: This is extremely hazy and should be revised.


.. 132

Fine arts & Liberal arts
========================

We distinguish between two large classes of books: `fine art`_ and
`liberal art`_ which differ on:

1. Intention of the author
2. The satisfaction its afford readers

`Fine arts`_ and `liberal arts`_ require different `complex skills`_ to
appreciate. Both skills are necessary for decent literacy since few books fit
neatly into either class, and many `great books`_, especially works of history,
intentionally do not. [#]_

.. 135

Books which treat of the appreciation or criticism of `fine art`_ are themselves
`liberal arts`_. [#]_ After reading this book you can read those and learn how
to read the other way. In general, you will find the greatest help from those
books which formulate the rules and exemplify them in practice. [#]_

.. 137

Read books with a purpose
=========================

One should satisfy one's purpose by going to a book written with a similar
intention, but know the same book can be read in different ways and according
to different purposes (do not make the mistakes of `purism`_ or `obscurantism`_).
The author may have had more than one intention, although one is likely to be
primary and dictate the obvious character of the book. Whatever you do in the
way of reading, you must know what you are doing and obey the rules for doing
that sort of things. There is no error in reading a poem as if it were
philosophy so long as you know which you are doing at a given time and how to
do it well.

**************************
Catching on from the title
**************************

:Pages: 140-160 (20)
:Abstract:
    It is important to know what kind of book one is reading before reading it
    because different kinds of books cannot be read in the same way. The
    primary kinds of `expository books`_ are `theoretical books`_ and
    `practical books`_. One may further classify `theoretical books`_  as
    `history`_, `science`_, or `philosophy`_. One can usually classify a book
    before reading it by reading it `front matter`_. One can identify specific
    kinds of books with specific rules.

.. contents::

.. 141
.. _rule 1.1:
.. |rule 1.1| replace:: Classify the book according to kind and subject matter

Rule 1.1: |rule 1.1|
====================

*You must know what kind of (`expository`_) book you are reading, and you should
know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to
read*

.. 158

This is because different `kinds of books`_ exist, which each have different
kinds of knowledge to communicate and different problems to solve, which
require different methods to solve and different methods of writing to explain,
which require different kinds of reading to follow. If a reader does not know
the kind of book he is reading, he will become perplexed and he may be unable
to ask or answer a large number of questions about the book.

.. 147

Kinds of books
--------------

A good reader must not only be able to classify books as the same kind, he
also needs to know what kinds there are. Many schemes of classification
exist, but we need one which groups books with an eye to the problems of
reading, and not for the purpose of selling them or putting them on shelves.
We primarily classify `expository books`_ as `theoretical`_ or `practical`_
and may further classify `theoretical books`_  as `history`_, `science`_, or 
`philosophy`_. [#]_


How to classify books
---------------------

One often can classify a book by studying its `front matter`_. This is
preferable to classifying a book by reading it, since it is useful to know what
kinds of book one is reading before reading. Be aware that front matter may be
misleading, and that some books cannot be neatly classified, often because
unskilled authors are unaware of distinctions.

.. 149

Practical books can be identified by noticing "the art of", "how to", or the
names of practical fields (such as  economics, ethics, and politics) in the
title, identifying it as a manual, guidebook, oration, political speech, or
moral treatise, identifying persuasive writing, noticing it tells you either
what you `should` do or `how` to do it, and noticing frequent occurrence of
such words as "should", "ought", "good", "bad", "ends", "means", "better",
"worse", "right", and "wrong".

`History`_ books can usually be identified by spotting "history" in the title
or being informed by the front matter that a book is about the past. `Science`_
and `philosophy`_ books are harder to identify because they are easy to mistake
for each other since both have titles that are the name of the subject matter
that they deal with, both seek general truths, and both claim frequently claim
the same subjects. Roughly though, if a `theoretical book`_ refers to things
which lie outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily experience, it is
scientific, otherwise it is philosophical, since science requires special
observation for support which requires elaborate experiments, but philosophy
needs only common observations ("armchair thinking").


.. 160

*******************
Seeing the skeleton
*******************

:Pages: 160-185 (25)
:Abstract:
    To grasp a complex entity like a book, one must grasp its `unity`_ and its
    `complexity`_. One should do this by writing a concise statement of the
    unity, a blueprint of its structure, and noting the problems the author is
    trying to solve.

.. _rule 1.2:

Rule 1.2: |rule 1.2|
====================

The `unity`_ of a book determines the arrangement of its parts. Thus, the
writer's task is to have one that is perfect and pervasive and the reader's task
is to find it. The reader can only find the `unity`_ of a book by reading it
entirely. This is because fiction books rarely state the `unity`_ to keep the
reader in suspense (as with fiction few plots exist in the world) and
`expository`_ books, though they typically state the `unity`_ early to convince
the reader of reading through, occasionally diverge from it.

The only way to test whether one understands the `unity`_ is to state it
as well as possible. A `unity`_ is stated well insofar as it is concise,
accurate, comprehensive, and indicative of a book's structure. As quite
different statements may be equally good or bad, readers may state the unity in
various ways, including ways different than the writer.

.. 163
.. _rule 1.3:

Rule 1.3: |rule 1.3|
====================

Though the major parts of a book may be seen at the moment when you grasp its
`unity`_, these parts are usually themselves complex and have an interior
structure you must see. Hence the third rule involves more than just an
enumeration of the parts: it means treating the parts as if they were
subordinates wholes, each with a `unity`_ and `complexity`_ of its own.

Complete analysis is expensive, [#]_ even for `great books`_ which have the most
intelligible structure, and the reader should do so only insofar as he profits.
The reader may use the writer's chapters headings and sectional divisions as an
aid, but he must make his own blueprint since writers try to conceal the
structure artistically and often fail to keep it intact.

.. _rule 1.4:

Rule 1.4: |rule 1.4|
====================

This rule repeats in another form `rule 1.2`_ and `rule 1.3`_: A reader should
be able to precisely formulate the main problems (or questions) and their subordinate
problems and be able to put them in an intelligible order. This rule is most
pertinent to the `great books`_, since as `original communications`_ the authors
started out with problems and ended by writing the solutions. The reader may
improve his ability to detect an author's problems by studying the kinds of
questions anyone can ask about anything. [#]_

***************
Coming to terms
***************

:Pages: 185-209 (24)

Coming to terms is the first stage of interpretation. Unless the reader comes to
terms with the author, the communication of knowledge from one to the other does
not take a place.

.. _rule 2.1:

Rule 2.1: |rule 2.1|
====================

    One of the primary rules for reading anything is to spot the most important
    words the author uses. Spotting them is not enough, however. You have to
    know how they are being used. Find an important word merely begins the more
    difficult research for the meanings, one or more, common or special, which
    the word is used to convey as it appears here and there in the text.

..

    When you start out to investigate the various senses of a word, it is
    usually wise to begin with a dictionary and you known own knowledge of
    common knowledge.

Find the most important words and through them `come to terms`_ with the author.
(187)

Note that the rule has two parts. (Each rule for the second reading does)

1. Locate the words which make a difference
2. Determine their meanings, as used, with precision

Interpreting a book is a kind of detective work. Finding the important words is
locating the clues. Coming to terms through them is running down the author's
thought.

Theses rules have a grammatical and a logical aspect. The grammatical step is
the one which deals with words. The logical step deal with their meanings, or
more precisely, with terms. So far as communicated is concerned, both steps are
indispensable; if language is sued without though, nothing is being
communicated.

As arts, grammar and logic are concerned with language in relation to though and
though in relation to language.

    That is why I said earlier that skill in reading and writing is gained
    through these liberal arts, especially grammar and logic. (where? that is an
    interesting argument)

.. 188

Language
========

If language were a pure and perfect medium for thought, these steps would not be
separate; interpretation would be unnecessary. Given that language is not ideal,
the only reasonable thing to do is make the best of language as it is, and the
only way to do that is to use language as skillfully as possible.

Because language is an imperfect medium, it also functions as an obstacle to
communication. **The rules of interpretative reading are directed to overcoming
that obstacles.**

We can expect a good writer to do his best to reach us through the barrier
language inevitably sets up, but we cannot expect him to do it all. In fact, we
must him halfway. The chance of meeting of minds through language depends on the
willingness of both reader and writer to work toward each other just as teaching
will not avail unless there is reciprocal activity of being taught.

The reciprocity here is founded on the fact that the rules of good reading and
writing are ultimately the same in principle.

Most of the words an author uses are unimportant and used in an everyday sense
(one qualification: words at different times and place are not the same). Only
those words which he uses in a special way are important for him, and for us as
readers. This is a matter of degree: words may be more or less important.

You cannot locate the important words without making an effort to understand the
passage in which they occur. This is somewhat paradoxical, as if you understand
the passage you will of course know which words in it are the most important.

If you are mark the words that trouble you, you may hit the very ones the author
is using specially. That this is likely to be so follows form the fact that you
should have no trouble with the words the author uses in an ordinary way. From
your point of view as a reader, the most important words are those which give
you trouble.

Positive signs
--------------

1. Explicit stress an author places upon certain words and not others.

   He may do this in several ways.

   - Typographical devices, as quotation marks or italics.
   - Explicitly discussing it various senses and the way he is going to use it
     here and there.
   - Giving a precising definition.
   - Quarrels with other writers about it.

Every field of knowledge has its own technical vocabulary, which must be
discovered by the reader.

If the author has not pointed out the words himself, the reader may locate them
through having some prior knowledge of the subject matter. If you know what kind
of book it is, what it is about as a whole, and what its major parts are, you
are greatly aided in separate the technical vocabulary from the ordinary words.

Unfortunately, there are many field in which a technical vocabulary is not well
established. Philosophers are notorious for having private vocabularies. They
often find it necessary to coin new words or to overload an existing word.

----

Remember that spotting the important words is only the beginning of the task. It
merely locates the places in the text where you have to go to work. There is
another step is carrying out this first rule of interpretative reading.

Let us suppose that you have the marked the words that trouble you. What next?

Two major possibilities:

1. The author is using these words in a single sense throughout.

   Here the words stand for a single term, as in Euclid.

2. The author is using them in two or more senses, shifting his meaning from
   place to place

   Here the word stands for several terms, as in Locke. This is the more usual
   case.

Procedure:

1. Try to determine whether the word has one or many meanings.
2. If many, try to see whether they are related and how.
3. Note the places where the word is use in one sense or another, and see if the
   context gives you any clues to the reason for the shift in meaning.

   This will enable you to follow the word in its change of meanings with the
   same flexibility that characterizes the author's usage.

How does one find out what the meaning are? There is only one way. You have to
discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meanings of
all the other words in the context which you do understand. This is not an easy
job, but is possible.

A good jigsaw puzzle is one all of whose parts fits; the picture can be
perfectly completed. The same is true of the ideally good book. But there are
few books of this sort. In proportion as they are good, their terms will be so
well made and put together by the author that the reader can do the work
interpretation fruitfully.

Find if you can the paragraphs in a book which state its important arguments;

taking a sentence from this paragraph, and one from that, until you have
gathered together the sequence of sentences which the state the propositions
that composed the argument.

.. tip::

   Remember that every argument must involve a number of statements. Of these,
   some give the reasons why you should accept a conclusion the author is
   proposing. If you find find the conclusions first, then look for the
   reasons. If you find the reasons first, see what they lead to. (231)

.. tip::

   Discriminate between the kind of argument which points to one or more
   particular facts as evidence for some generalization and the kind which
   offers a series of general statements to prove some further generalizations.

   General propositions which are called self-evident, or axioms, are
   propositions we know to be true as soon as we understand their terms. Such
   propositions are ultimately derived from our experience of particulars. (231)

   Observe:
   
   - what things the author says he must assume
   - what he says can be proved or otherwise evidenced
   - what need not be proved because it is self-evident

The etiquette of talking back

:Pages: 235-251 (16)

Reading a book is a kind of conversation. The reader has the last word, but
the reader must not be judge before reading fully because the author cannot
defend himself.

    Ordinary conversations between persons who confront each other are good
    only when they are carried on decently. I am not thinking merely of the
    decencies according to conventions of social politeness. There is in
    addition, an intellectual etiquette one should observe. Without it,
    conversation is bickering rather than profitable communication. I am
    assuming here, of course, that the conversation is about a serious matter
    on which men can agree or disagree. Then it becomes important that they
    conduct themselves well. Otherwise there is no profit in the enterprise.
    The profit in good conversation is something learned.

If the reader does not understand and if the fault is with the book, rather than
with the reader, the reader must locate the sources of trouble. He should be
able to do show that its structure is unintelligible. To the extent that a
reader can support his charge that a book is unintelligible, he has no further
critical obligations.

Let us suppose you are a reading a good book and understand it. If you agree
with what the author says, the work is over. You have been enlightened,
convinced, or persuaded. This is the usual case.

The reader must be acquainted with the principles of argument. The reader can
ultimately reach significant agreement or disagreement with the author only by
meeting the author's arguments, not by simply following them.

The reader who `comes to terms` with an author and grasps his propositions and
reasoning, is *en rapport* with the author's mind.

.. 252. I think this is an important note:

Aside: The whole process of interpretation is directed toward a meeting of minds
through the medium of language. Understanding a book can be described as a kind
of agreement between writer and reader. They agree about the use of language to
express idea.

************************
And still more rules
************************

:Pages: 266-291 (25)

There are a few point to make about the utility of looking outside the book you
are reading in order to read it well.

In any art, rules have a disappointing way of being too general. The more
general, the fewer, but also the more remote they are from the intricacies  of
the actual situation in which you try to follow them.

So far the rules have been stated generally enough to apply to any instructive
book, but you cannot read a book in general.

The most important thing about any practical book is that it can never solve the
practical problems with which it is concerned. Action is required. This is in
contrast to a theoretical book, which can solve its own problems.

Every action takes place in a particular situation under special circumstances.
You cannot act in general. The kind of practical judgment which immediately
precedes action must be highly particular.

A book rarely will give such concrete advice, so rarely is such advice is every
written. Only someone in the same exact situation could help.

Practical books fall into two main groups. Those the primarily present rules (of
which, no great books are) and those that are primarily concerned with the
principles which generate rules (e.g. great books in economics, politics, and
morals).

In reading a book which is primarily a rulebook, the major propositions too look
for, of course, are the rules. You can always recognize a rule because it
recommend something as worth doing to gain a certain end. The arguments in a
practical book will be attempts to show you that the rules are sound. The writer
may appeal to principles or simply illustrate their soundness by showing how
they work in on concrete cases. The former is less persuasive, but it can
explain the reason for the rules better than examples of their use can.

In the other kind, the major of propositions and arguments will look exactly
like those in a purely theoretical book. The propositions will say that
something is the case, and the arguments will try to show that it is so.
However, there is an important difference between reading a such a book and a
purely theoreitcal one- since ultimate problems to be solved are practical, an
intelligent reader always readings between the lines and see the rules which may
not be expressed, but may be derived from the general principles. Unless it is
so read, a practical book is not read as practical, and is read poorly. You
really do not understand it, and certainly cannot criticize it properly in any
other way.

In judging a theoretic book, the reader must observe the discrepancy between his
own basic assumptions and those of the author. In judging a partical book,
everything turns on the ends or goals, not the means.

Two clues to the major questions you must ask about yourself in reading any sort
of practical book:

1. What are the author's objectives?
2. What means is he proposing?

Answering both of these is necessary for the understanding and criticism of a
practical book.

Since the ultimate judgment of a practical work is based on its ends, the author
must be something of an orator or propagandist. There is nothing wrong or
vicious about this; it is the nature of practical affairs. No one makes serious
practical judgments or engages in action without being moved somehow from below
the neck. The writer of practical books who does not realize this will be
ineffective.

.. 274 todo: resume at "The best protection..."

.. 280 - Extrinsic reading scientific work

Scientific work
    The report of findings or conclusions in some field of research, whether
    carried on experimentally in a laboratory or by observations of nature in
    the raw.

The scientific problem is always to describe the phenomena as accurately as
possible and to trace the interconnections among different kinds of phenomena.

In the great works of science, there is no oratory or propaganda, though there
may be bias in the sense of initial presuppositions. You can detect this by
distinguishing what the author assumes from what he establishes through
argument. The more objective a scientific author is, the more he will explicitly
beg you to take this or that for granted. Scientific objectivity is not the
absence of initial bias; it is attained by a frank confession of it.

The leading terms in a scientific work are usually expressed by uncommon or
technical words. They are relatively easy to spot. Through them you can readily
grasp the propositions. The main propositions are always general ones, since
science tries to say how things are generally.

The only point of difficulty is with respect to arguments. Science is primarily
inductive. To understand and judge the inductive arguments in a scientific book,
you must be able to follow the evidence which the scientists reports as their
basis. Sometimes descriptions or diagrams illustrate the phenomena. In the worst
case the reader must get the special experience for himself first hand (perhaps
at a museum). This is reason why a good school would require laboratory work for
students.

> The scientific classics become more intelligible to those who have seen with
their own eyes and done with their own hands what a great scientist describes as
as the procedure by which he reached his insights.

**Thus, the major extrinsic aid in the read of scientific books is not the
reading of other books, but rather getting a direct acquaintance with the
phenomena involved.**

Other books may be helpful, but the primary aid is experiment.

.. 282 - Philosophical

Ethical and political books have already been treated. (practical philosophy)

Here we treat theoretic works, such as metaphysics.

The philosophical problem is to explain, not to describe, the nature of things.
It asks more about the connection of phenomena. It seeks to penetrate to the
ultimate causes and conditions of things.

The basic terms of philosophy and science are abstract. No general knowledge is
expressible except in abstract terms. Whenever you talk generally about anything
you are using abstractions.

Just as the inductive argument should be the reader's main focus in the case of
scientific books, so here you must pay closest attention to the philosopher's
principles or beginnings.

.. todo: skipped a lot to 286

There are two further points about extrinsic reading in connection with
philosophical books:

1. Do not spend all your time reading books about the philosophers, their lives,
   and opinions. Trying reading the philosophers themselves, in relation to one
   another.

2. Note the data of the philosopher you are reading. This will place his
   properly in the conversation with those who cam before and after, and prper
   you for the sort of scientific imagery he will employ to illustrate some of
   his points.

.. 288 - Summary

Summary:

What lies beyond the book you are reading? Three things:

1. Experience, common or special

2. Other books (of various sorts: reference books, secondary books,
   commentaries, other great books, dealing with the same or related matters)

3. Live discussion

    > I like to think of the great books as involved in a prolonged conversation
    about the basic problems of mankind. The great authors were great readers,
    and one way to understand them is to read the books they read. As readers,
    they carried on a conversation with other authors, just as each of us
    carries on a conversation with the books we read, though we may not write
    other books.

    To get into conversations, we must read the great books in relation to each
    other and in an order that somehow respects chronology. The conversation of
    the books takes place in time.

    While this is not indispensable, it is certainly a great help. Hence, why
    teachers meet with students to discuss them. The reader who learns to
    discuss a book well with other with other readers may come thereby to have
    better conversations with the author when he has him alone in his study.

Following all the rules of intrinsic reading is seldom sufficient to read any
book well, either interpretatively or critically. Experience and other books
are dispensable extrinsic aids.

The utility of extrinsic reading is simply an extension of the value of context
in read a book by itself. We have seen how the context must be used to interpret
words and sentences to find terms and propositions. Just as the whole book is a
context for any of its parts, so related books provide an even larger context
that helps you interpret the ones you are reading.

################################################################################
Critique of Education
################################################################################

.. 58

(The proliferation of textbooks and lecture courses in our educational system
today is the surest sign of our declining literacy. A textbook or manual might
almost be defined as a pedagogical invention for getting "something" into the
heads of those who cannot read well enough to learn more actively.  An ordinary
classroom lecture is a similar device. When teachers no longer know how to
perform the function of reading books *with* their students, they are forced to
lecture *at* them instead.)


.. 58

It happens to be the case, of course, that most of the primary teachers are
dead -- the men are dead and the books they have left us are dead teachers --
whereas most of the living teachers are secondary. But suppose that we could
resuscitate the primary teachers of all times. Suppose there was a college or
university in which the faculty was thus composed. Would anyone want to go to
any university if he could get into this one? There need be no limitation on
numbers. The price of admission -- the only entrance requirement -- is the
ability and willingness to read.

The great books can be read in our of school. If they are read in school, in
classes under the supervision of live teachers, the latter must properly
subordinate themselves to the dead ones.

For many centuries, education was regarded as the elevation of a mind by its
betters. If we are honest, most of us living teachers should be willing to admit
that, apart from the advantages which age bestows, we are not much better than
our students in intellectual caliber or attainment. If elevation is to take
place, better minds than ours will have to do the teaching.

One might object that great books are too difficult for most of us, in school
our out. That is why we are forced to get our education from secondary teachers,
from classroom lectures, textbooks, popularizations, which repeat and digest for
us what would otherwise forever remain a closed book. Even though our aim is
understanding, not information, we must be satisfied with a less rich diet. We
suffer incurable limitations. The masters are too far above us. This I deny. For
one thing, the less rich diet is likely not be genuinely nourishing at all. The
latter cannot be substituted for the former, because you cannot get the same
thing out of them.

The path of true learning is strewn with rocks, not roses. Anyone who insists
upon taking the easier way ends up in a fool's paradise-- a sophomore all his
life.

The great books can be read by every man. The help he needs from secondary
teachers does not consist of the get-learning-quick substitutes. It consists of
help in learning how to read, and more than that when possible, help actually in
the course of reading the great books.

Let me argue a bit further the point the great books are the most readable. In
some cases, of course, they are difficult to read. They require the greatest
ability to read. The art of teaching demands a corresponding and proportionate
art of being taught. But, at the same time the great books are the most
competent to instruct us about the subject matters with which they deal. If we
had the skill necessary to read them, we would find them the easiest.

There is something of a paradox here. It is due to the fact that two different
kinds of mastery are involved. There is, on the one hand, the author's mastery
of his subject matter; on the other, there is our need to master the book he has
written. These books are recognized as great because of their mastery, and we
rate ourselves as reader according to the degree of our ability to master these
books.

If our aim in reading is to gain knowledge and insight, then the great books are
the most readable, both for the less and for the more competent, because they
are the most instructive. Obviously, I do not mean "most readable" in the sense
of "with the least effort" -- even for the expert reader. I mean that these
books reward every degree of effort and ability to the maximum. It maybe hard
to dig for gold than for potatoes, but each unit of successful effort is more
amply repaid.

Are you reading for information or understanding?

Heuristic: Anything easily digested is reading for information

*   Newspaper

Claim: not really learning anything new

You need to find writers who are more knowledgable on a particular subject than yourself.

Mortimery Adler wrote the book on reading in "How to Read a Book". Identified four levels of reading:

1.  Elementary

    The level of reading taught in our elementary schools.

2.  Inspectional

    Inspectional reading allows us to look at the authors blueprint and evaluate
    the merits of a deeper reading experience

    There are two types of inspectional reading:

    1.  Systematic skimming

        This is meant to be a quick check of the book by:

        1.  Reading the preface
        2.  Studying the table of contents
        3.  Checking the index
        4.  Reading the inside jacket

        This should give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in
        the book pivotal to the authors argument.

        Skimming helps you reach a decision point: Does this book deserve more
        of my time and attention?

    2.  Superficial reading

3.  Analytical

    Analytical reading is a thorough reading; the best you can do given an
    unlimited time.

    Rules to analytic reading:

    -   Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
    -   State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity
    -   Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole
    -   Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve

    Though these may sound easy, they involve a lot of work.

    When you're done this, you may understand the book but not the broader
    subject. To do this, you need to use comparative reading to synthesize
    knowledge from several books on the same subject.

4.  Syntopical

    This is also known as comparative reading and it represents the most
    demanding and difficult reading of all.

    Syntopical reading involves reading many books on the same subject and
    comparing and contrasting ideas.

    There are five steps to syntopical reading:

    1. Find the relevant passages
    2. Bring the author to terms
    3. Get the questions clear
    4. Define the issues
    5. Analyze the discussion

These are thought of as levels because you can't move to a higher level without
a firm understanding of the previous one.

The goal of reading determines how you read. The goal of reading a romance novel
is different from reading the newspaper which is different from reading Plato.

    Communication succeeds only when it results in a common something, as an
    item of knowledge which two men have in common. When there is unresolved
    ambiguity in communication, there is no communication, or at best it must be
    incomplete.
   
    Successful communication occurs in any case where what the writer wanted to
    have received finds its way into the reader's possession. The writer's and
    reader's skill converge upon a common end.

    For communication to be successful, it is necessary for two parties to use

    Great books are usually called "classics", but that word has for most people
    a wrong and forbidding connotation -- wrong in the sense of referring to
    antiquity, and forbidding in the sense of sounding unreadable. Great books
    are being written today and were written yesterday as well as long ago, and
    far from being unreadable, the great books are the most readable and those
    which most deserve to be read.

    Only after you have read some of the great books competently will you have
    an intimate grasp of the standards by which other books can be judged as
    great or good.

    Great books are like popularizations in that most of them are written for
    ordinary men and not for pedants of scholars. To the extent that they are
    original, they have to address themselves to an audience which starts from
    scratch. However, unlike textbooks and popularizations, the great books

History
    History is knowledge of particular events or things which not only existed
    in the past, but underwent a series of changes in the course of time.

    The historian narrates these happenings and often colors his narrative
    with some comment on, or insight into, the significance of the events.

Information
    Information refers to facts or knowing *that*. One can test for information
    by testing recall.

Instruction
    Communication to convey knowledge.

    Instruction occurs occurs when one man teaches another through discourse.

    Teach is the process whereby one man learns from another through
    communication.

    When being instructed, the learner acts on something communicated to him.
    He performs operations on discourse.
    
    (Note, that if we overlook some minor differences, we can say that reading
    and listening are the same art -- the art of being taught.)

Intrinsic reading
    Reading a book in itself, apart from all other books.

.. _learning:

Learning
    We stipulate "learning" to mean the process of acquiring knowledge (in the
    everyday sense). (Foregoing skill_).

    The two ways of learning are instruction_ and discovery_. The two may help
    each other.

.. _learning_curve:

Learning curve
    A graphical representation of a person's skill versus their experience,
    which is typically curved due to improvement in skill becoming harder as
    experience increases.

.. _learning_plateau:

Learning plateau
    A span of time in which a learner's skill remains constant despite
    additional experienced.
    
    Learning plateaus are not found in all learning curves, but only in those
    which record progress in gaining a `complex skill`_. The more complex the
    skill, the more frequently learning plateaus appear.

    Learning goes on during learning plateaus, but it does not manifest as
    an improvement in skill.
    
    One explanation is that during a learning plateau the learner combines
    simple acts into a complex one, and only when he has mastered the complex
    act does his skill visibly improve. Thus, in order to perform a complex act
    (like reading or playing tennis) one needs to master each of its component 
    acts (such that they become automatic), and then master them in
    combination. (One cannot think about beating one's opponent in tennis
    until one can reliably return a ball.)

.. _live teacher:
.. _live teachers:

Live teacher
    A speaking teacher; a teacher we learn from by listening. A human being with
    whom we have some personal contact.

    Unlike a `dead teacher`_, a live teacher may teach us skills_ by *showing*
    us how or helping us directly go through the motions. Without a live
    teacher, we have to develop skill by practicing according to rules in a
    book, without being stopped, corrected, and shown how. (Though it certainly
    can be done.)

    Considered as a source of knowledge, live teachers either compete with or
    cooperate with `dead teachers`_.
    
    - By competition, I mean the way in which many live teachers tell their
      students by lectures what the students could learn by reading the books
      the lecturer himself digested. (Long before the magazine existed, live
      teachers earned their living by being "reader's digests".
      
    - By cooperations I mean the way in which the live teacher somehow divides
      the function of teaching between himself and the available books: some
      things he tells the students and some things he expects the student to
      learn by reading.

    If these were the only functions a live teacher performed, it would follow
    that anything which can be learned in school can be learned outside of
    school and without live teachers. (It might take a little more trouble to
    read for yourself than to have books digested for you. You might have to
    read more books, if books were your only teachers. But to whatever extent it
    is true that the live teacher has no knowledge to communicate except he
    himself learned by reading, you can learn it directly from books yourself,
    provided you can read as well.) Moreover, if you seek is understanding
    rather than information, reading will take you further. Most people are even
    more likely to be passive in listening to a lecture than reading a book.
    Note-taking is usually not an active assimilation of what is to be
    understood, but an almost automatic record of what was said.

    There are two other functions a live teacher performs, by which he relates
    to books.

    1. Repetition. This is not really useful though, because if a student had
       read the assigned text he would have gotten what he wanted anyway, and if
       he was unable to, he would be less likely to be able to understand the
       lecture.

    2. Original communication. This used to be more common before printing.
       Students would travel all over Europe to hear a famous lecturer. This
       function is uncommon today. Few teachers have original communications to
       make (most simply repeat or digest, and students could learn everything
       he knows by reading the books he has read).

    The only justification for living teacher then is a practical one.

    The self-educated man is as rare as the self-made man. Most men do not
    become genuinely learned or amass large fortunes through their own efforts.
    The existence of such men, however, shows it can be done. Their rarity
    indicates the exceptional qualities of character required. In knowledge, as
    in wealth, most of us have to be spoon-fed to the little we possess.

    There is one except however.

    (They need not be original in entirety of course. On the contrary, complete
    originality is both impossible and misleading. It is impossible except at
    the hypothetical beginning of cultural tradition. It is misleading because
    no one should try to discover for himself what he can be taught by others.
    The best sort of originality is that which adds something to the fund of
    knowledge made available by the tradition of learning. Ignorance or neglect
    of the tradition is likely to result in a false or shallow originality.)

    The `great books`_ in all fields of learning are original communications.

Purism
    The error of supposing that a given book can be read in only one way.

    It is an error because books are not pure in character, and that in turn
    is due to the fact that the human mind, which writes or reads them, is
    rooted in the senses and imagination and moves or is moved by emotion
    and sentiment.

.. _reading:

Reading
    We stipulate "reading" to mean the active mental process of interpreting or
    understanding text; the process of receiving written communication.

    We primarily divide reading into `reading for amusement`_ and  `reading for
    instruction`_.

Reading for information
    Passive_ `reading for instruction`_ for gaining information_ (e.g.

    Reading for information makes up the majority of time reading and is the
    only kind lesser readers can do.

    Reading for information is the only kind of reading require by most schools.

    `Reading for instruction`_ may be divided into `reading for information`_
    and `reading for understanding`_.

.. _reading for instruction:

Reading for instruction
    Reading primarily for receiving instruction_.

    Some, but not all learning can be achieved through reading: we can learn
    knowledge *that* through reading but not skill. At best a book can aid one can
    learn the nature of an art and its rules.

.. _read for understanding:
.. _reading for understanding:

Reading for understanding
    Active_ `reading for instruction`_ for gaining understanding_.

    There are two conditions under which reading for understanding takes place:

    1. Initially, the writer understands_ more than the reader, and is
       communicating something which can increase the reader's understanding.
       (If the writer does understand more than we do, we can only be informed
       by him.)

    2. The reader is able to overcome this inequality to some degree and
       approach equality with the writer.

    books. You may actually have have to witness an experiment unless you can use
    your imagination to construct something as you have never observed.

.. _secondary:

.. _secondary teachers:

Secondary teacher

    The secondary teacher is simply a better student, and he should regard
    himself as learning from the masters along with his younger charges. He
    should not act as if he were the primary teacher, using a great book as if
    it were just another textbook of the sort one of his colleagues might write.
    The primary sources of his own knowledge should be the primary sources of
    learning for his students.

    Textbooks and popularizations of all sorts are written for people who do not
    know how to read or can read only for information.  As dead teachers, they
    are like the live secondary teachers who wrote them.

    Alive or dead, a secondary teacher tries to impart knowledge without
    requiring too much too skillful activity on the part of the learner. Theirs
    is an art of teaching which demands the least art of being taught in the
    students. They stuff the mind rather than enlighten it. The measure of their
    success is how much the sponge will absorb.

    When avoid effort in learning, we find ourselves with the results of
    effortless learning: assorted vagaries we collect by letting secondary
    teachers indoctrinate us. If you paid the greater price in effort, you would
    be rewarded by better goods.

    One obvious fact shows the existence of a wide range of degrees in the
    ability to read is that reading begins in the primary grades and runs
    through every level of the educational system. Since what we have to learn,
    as we ascend in our education, becomes more difficult or complex, we must
    improve our ability to read proportionately.

    Supposedly, gradations in reading go along with graduations from one
    educational level to another. This supposition is not well founded, however,
    as in the US, there is little discernible difference between the literacy of
    a high school student and a college senior. But, this fact means only that
    the gradations have become more obscure for us, not that they do not exist.

.. [8]
    The accuracy of such measurement depends, of course, on the independent
    precision with which we can grade the tasks in difficulty. We would be
    moving in circles if we said, for instance, that the more difficult book is
    one which only the better reader can master.

    In order to understand what makes some books more difficult to read than
    others, we would have to know what demands they make on the skill of the
    reader.

    The difficulty of the reading matter is a convenient, objective sign of
    degrees of reading ability, but it does not tell us what the difference is
    in that reader, so far as his skill is concerned.

.. [11]
    Adler tells a story:

    Here is a book, I said, and here is your mind. The book consists of language
    written by someone for the sake of communicating something to you. Your
    success in reading is determined by the extent to which you get all that
    writer intended to communicate.

    Now, as you go through the pages either you understand perfectly everything
    the author has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained
    information, but you could not have increased understand. If upon effortless
    inspection, a book is completely intelligible to you, then the author and
    you are as two minds in the same mold. The symbols on the page merely
    express the common understanding your had before you met.

    Let us take the second alternative. You do not understand the book perfectly
    at once. Let us assume even that you understand enough to know you do not
    understand it all. You know there is more in the book than you understand
    and hence, that the book contains something which can increase your
    understanding. What do you do then?

    You can do a number of things.

    You can take the book to someone else who, you think, can read better than
    you, and have him explain the parts that troubled you.

    Or you can get him to recommend a textbook or commentary which will make it
    all plain by telling you what the author meant.

    Or you may decide, as many students do, that what's over your head isn't
    worth bothering about, that you understand enough, and the rest doesn't
    matter.

    If you do any of these things, you are not doing the job of reading which
    the book requires. That is done in one way only. Without external help, you
    take the book into your study and work on it. With nothing but the power of
    your mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that you
    gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of
    understanding more.

    Such elevation, accomplished by the mind working on a book, is reading, the
    kind of reading that a book which challenges your understanding deserves.

    Thus I roughly defined what I mean by reading: the process whereby a mind,
    with nothing to operate on the but the symbols of readable matter, and with
    not help from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations.
    The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more.

    The operations which causes this to happen are the various acts which
    constitute the art of reading. "How many of these acts do you know?" I asked
    three thousand teachers. "What things would you do by yourself if your lif
    depended on understanding something readable which at first perusal left you
    somewhat in the dark?"
