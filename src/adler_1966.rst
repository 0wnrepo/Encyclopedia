This is a book for readers who cannot read.

There are many kinds of reading and degrees of ability to read.

This book is for readers who want to read better or want to read in some other way than they now can.

This book is for people who cannot read at all (e.g. infants, imbeciles) and masters.

    Most of us know that we are are not expert reader. We know this in many ways, but most obviously when we find some things too difficult to read, or have great trouble in reading them; or when someone else has read the same thing we have and shown us how much we missed or misunderstood... Most of us have experienced difficulties in reading, but we do not know why we have trouble or what to do about it.

    I think this is because most of us do not regard reading as a complicated activity, involving many different steps in each of which we can acquire more and more skill through practice, as in the case of any other art. We may not even think there is an art of reading. We tend to think of reading almost as if it were something as simple and natural to do as looking or walking. There is no art of looking or walking. 


    I told him that this book was like a book on how to play tennis.

    As written about in books, the art of tennis consists of rules for making each of the various strokes, a discussion of how and when to use them, and a description of how to organize these parts into the general strategy of a successful game. The art of reading has to be written about in the same way. There are rules for each of the different steps you must take to complete the reading of a whole book.

Knowing how to read well was like any other art or skill.

    For every illusion that the classroom can nourish, there is a school  of hard knocks to destroy it.

    Here I wish only to record this fact about our schools, a fact which concerns us all, because in large part they have made us what we are today—people who cannot read well enough to enjoy reading for profit or profit by reading for enjoyment. (11)

    But education does not stop with schooling, nor does the responsibility for the ultimate educational fate of each of us rest entirely on the school system. Everyone can and must decide for himself whether he is satisfied with the education he got, or is now getting if he is still in school. If he is not satisfied, it is up to him to do something about it. With schools as they are, more schooling is hardly the remedy. One way out—perhaps the only one available to most people—is to learn to read better, and then, by reading better, to learn more of what can be learned through reading. (11)

From many rules to one habit
****************************

:Abstract: 
    Reading is a `complex skill`_.

    Reading is either intrinsic_ or extrinsic_.
    
    Intrinsic reading consists of understanding_ and criticism_.

    Understanding_ consists of analysis and synthesis.

Three ways of reading
=====================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

.. 124

A good book deserves three readings.

1.  Understanding_

    1. Analytic Reading
    2. Synthetic Reading

2.  Critical

    3. Critical Reading

These three readings are not three in time, but three in manner: three ways of
reading a book.

The first two readings are reading for understanding. As a reader becomes
expert, these may be performed simultaneously. The third is distinct, as a
reader must understand an author before criticizing him.

The first two readings and the third must be done somewhat separately;
understanding the author must always precede criticizing or judging him.

.. 126

    If you had to check your reading of a book, you would have to divide the
    whole process into its parts. You might have to re-examine separately each
    step you took, though at the time you did not take it separately, so
    habitual had the process of reading become.

.. 127

    The teacher of English composition, going over a paper with a student and
    explaining his marks, points to this or that rule the student violated. At
    that time, the student must be reminded of the different rules, but the
    teacher does not want him to write with a rule sheet before him. He wants
    him to write well habitually, as if the rules were part of his nature. The
    same is true of reading.


.. _reading_1:
.. _reading_structural:

Reading 1: |reading 1|
----------------------

Here the reader proceeds from the whole to its parts.

Rules for the first reading:

#. |rule 1.1|_
#. |rule 1.2|_
#. |rule 1.3|_
#. |rule 1.4|_

Knowing `what the whole book is about <rule 1.2_>`_ and `what its main
divisions are <rule 1.3_>`_ will help you discover its leading terms and
propositions. If you can discover what the chief contentions of the author are
and how he supports these by arguments and evidence, you will be aided in
determine the general tenor his treatment and its major divisions.

.. _reading 2:
.. _reading interpretative:
.. _reading synthetic:
.. |reading 2| replace:: The interpretation of a book's contents

Reading 2: |reading 2|
----------------------

Here the reader proceeds from the parts to the whole.

The reader focuses on terms, propositions, and syllogisms; the author's ideas,
assertions, and arguments.

Rules for the second reading:

#. |rule 2.1|
#. |rule 2.2|
#. |rule 2.3|
#. |rule 2.4|

.. _reading_3:
.. _reading_critical:
.. _reading_evaluative:

Reading 3: |reading 3|
----------------------

Here the reader judges the author, and decides whether he agrees or disagrees.

.. At this point we have seen rules 1.1, 

Intrinsic reading & Extrinsic reading
=====================================

We distinguish between:

#. `intrinsic reading`_
#. `extrinsic reading`_

.. 127

Rule 0:
    |rule 0|

If authors are agreeing or disagreeing, one cannot be assured one understands
one of them unless they recognize such agreements and disagreements.

This applies especially to the `great books`_-- many of them are
difficult to read because they are related and have been written in a certain
order, such that reading earlier books may help understanding later books.

*see* `chapter 14`_

Rules of `extrinsic reading`_:

1.  Read related books in relation to each other and in an order which renders
    the later ones more intelligible


Criteria for rules of intrinsic reading
=======================================

1. The rules of intrinsic reading also apply to lectures
2. The rules only apply to reading a `whole` book, not to excerpts
3. The rules only apply to liberal arts, not fine arts

.. 129

The rules of intrinsic reading also apply to lectures
------------------------------------------------------

The rules of `intrinsic reading`_ apply equally to reading a book and to taking
a course of lectures.

Lectures require more expertise from users to be profitable:

-   Lectures require a greater exercise of memory or note taking than books
-   Books may be reexamined


.. 130

The rules only apply to reading a `whole` book, not to excerpts
---------------------------------------------------------------

The primary aim of these rules is to help you read a whole book; they would be
misused if applied mainly to excepts or small parts out of context.

One should not read small pieces spaced over time:

- Excerpts are far too short for a sustained effort of reading.
- The order in which excerpts are read make it impossible to grasp and real
  whole concept in itself or to understand one thing in relation to another.

.. TODO: This is extremely hazy and should be revised.


.. 132

Fine arts & Liberal arts
========================

We distinguish between two large classes of books: `fine art`_ and
`liberal art`_ which differ on:

1. Intention of the author
2. The satisfaction its afford readers

`Fine arts`_ and `liberal arts`_ require different `complex skills`_ to
appreciate, and both are necessary for decent literacy. Few books fit neatly
into either category, and many `great books`_ are intentionally not so. [#]_

.. 135

Books which treat of the appreciation or criticism of `fine art`_ are themselves
`liberal arts`_. [#]_ After reading this book you can read those and learn how
to read the other way. In general, you will find the greatest help from those
books which formulate the rules and exemplify them in practice. [#]_

.. 137

Read books with a purpose
=========================

One should satisfy one's purpose by going to a book written with a similar
intention, but know the same book can be read in different ways and according
to different purposes (do not make the mistakes of `purism`_ or `obscurantism`_).
The author may have had more than one intention, although one is likely to be
primary and dictate the obvious character of the book. Whatever you do in the
way of reading, you must know what you are doing and obey the rules for doing
that sort of things. There is no error in reading a poem as if it were
philosophy so long as you know which you are doing at a given time and how to
do it well. 

.. 140

**************************
Catching on from the title
**************************

:Abstract:
    It is important to know what kind of book you are reading because different
    kinds of book require different kinds of reading.

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Authors sometimes have mixed motives and they are subject to the failing of
wanting to do too many things at once. If they are confused in their
intentions, the reader cannot be blamed for not knowing how to follow them.
We put these books aside. There are enough books which are perfectly clear
in their intention and which, therefore, deserve a discriminating reading from
us.


.. 141
.. _rule 1.1:
.. |rule 1.1| replace:: Classify the book according to kind and subject matter

Rule 1.1: |rule 1.1|
====================

You must know what kind of (expository) book you are reading, and you should
know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to
read.

Everything is clear here except the last clause.

Classify the book according to kind and subject matter (185)

For the most part, people know the kind of book they are reading before they
start. They picked it out to read because it was of that kind. This is
certainly true of the main distinction in types of books.

While a liberal books deal in knowledge, they are also different and to read
them well we must read them in a manner appropriate to their differences.

.. 143

Front matter
============

A book always has a front matter and an introduction.

Front matter
    The front matter consists of:

    - the title
    - the subtitle
    - table of contents
    - preface

.. 143

The number of readers who pay no attention to the signals is larger than you
might suspect, unless you happen to be one of those who are honest enough to
admit it.

Few students are unable to answer what sort of book a book they just read was.
Sometimes they apologize by saying that they haven't finished reading it yet,
and therefore do not know.

One reason why front matter is ignored by readers is that they do not think it
is important to classify the book they are reading.

Obviously, the author thinks it is important for the reader to know the kind
of books he is being given. That is why he goes to the trouble of making it
plain in the preface, and usually tries to make his title more or less
descriptive.

.. 144

Authors also construct an analytical table of contents to advise the reader in
advance of the details of their treatment.

If the reader never asks this question, he is going to get more perplexed and
he may be unable to ask or answer a lot of other questions about the book.

.. 145

The clearest titles in the world, the most explicit front matter, will not
helper you classify a book, even if you pay attention to these signs, unless
you have the broad lines of classification already in mind.

.. 146

Titles sometimes make the grouping of books easy, but it is not always the
case.

To group books as being of the same kind is not enough, however. To follow
the first rule of reading you must know what the kind is.

The entire front matter will not tell you what kind unless you have some
categories you can apply to classify books intelligently.

This rule needs to be made a little more intelligible for you if you are to
follow it intelligently. This can be done only by a brief discussion of the
main kinds of expository books.

.. 147

We need a scheme of classification which groups books with an eye to the
problems of reading, and not for the purpose of selling them or putting them
on shelves.

Theoretical Books & Practical Books
===================================

.. _theoretical:

Theoretical Book
    A theoretical book concerns something to be seen or understood.

    Some books and some teachers are interested only in the knowledge itself which
    they have to communicate. This does not mean they deny its utility or, they
    insist knowledge is good `only` for its own sake. They simply limit themselves
    to one kind of teaching, and leave the other kind to other men.

    Theoretical books focus on `knowledge`-- knowing `that`.

.. _practical:

Practical Book
    A practical book has to do with what works in some way, at once or in the
    long run.

    Some books and teachers have an interest beyond knowledge for its own sake. They are
    concerned with the problems of human life with knowledge can be used to solve.
    They communicate knowledge, too, but always with an emphasis upon its
    application.

    Practical books focus on `action`-- knowing `how` to do something which
    you think you `should`.

    .. 149

    Every practical book is somewhat oratorical.

    .. 149

Identification
--------------

By title:

- "the art of"
- "how to"
- containing names of fields which are practical

Any "guidebook" is a practical book.

Any book which tells you either what you `should` do or `how` to do
it is practical.

.. 149

Includes:

- expositions of arts to be learned
- manuals of practice in any field, such as engineering or medicine or
  cooking
- treatises which are conventionally classified as morals, such as book on
  economic, ethical or political problems
- an oration -- a political speech or a moral exhortation
- anyone who writes practically about anything not only tries to advise
  you but also tries to get you to follow his advice

 By content:

 - Frequent occurrence of such words as "should", "ought", "good", "bad",
   "ends", "means", "better", "worse", "right", "wrong"


.. note::

    .. 148

    Are we not dealing with books which convey knowledge? How can action come in?

    Intelligent action depends on knowledge.

    .. 148

    Knowledge can be used in many ways, not only for controlling nature and
    inventing useful machines but also for directing human conduct and regulating
    man's operations in various fields of skill. What I have in mind here is
    exemplified between pure and applied and science, or as it is sometimes
    inaccurately phrased, science and technology.

    .. 148

    To make theoretical knowledge practical we must convert it into rules of
    operation.

.. 150

.. tip::

    Make your first effort to diagnose a book from its title and the rest of
    the front matter.

    If that is insufficient, you will have to depend on signs to be found in
    the main body of the text.

.. warning::

   Titles may be misleading-- books on practical subjects may be entirely
   theoretical.

.. warning::

    Some authors do not know the difference between theory and practice.

.. warning::

    Some books will be partly theoretical and partly practical.


History, Science & Philosophy
=============================

.. 152

Here we distinguish (not define) between history, science, and philosophy. [#]_

.. _history:

History
    History is knowledge of particular events or things which not only existed
    in the past, but underwent a series of changes in the course of time.

    The historian narrates these happenings and often colors his narrative
    with some comment on, or insight into, the significance of the events.

    *Identification*

    Usually "history" is in the title or the front matter informs us that
    this is a book about the past.

.. _science:

Science
    Science treat of matters that can happen at any time or place.

    Scientists seek laws or generalizations.

    Scientists seek to find out how things happen for the most part or in
    ever case.

    The rules of extrinsic reading are more complicated in the case of scientific
    books. You may actually have have to witness an experiment unless you can use
    your imagination to construct something as you have never observed.

.. _philosophy:

Philosophy
    ?

Science & Philosophy
--------------------

Distinguishing between science and philosophy can be difficult for a few
reasons:

-   The titles of science and philosophy are the name of the subject
    matter that they deal with.
-   Science and philosophy often claim the same subject.
-   Science and philosophy seek general truths.

Roughly, if a theoretic book refers to things which lie outside the scope
of your normal, routine, daily experience, it is a scientific work. If not,
it is philosophical.

A philosopher refers to the reader to his own normal and common experience
for the verification or support of anything he has to say. Science requires
special experience.

The distinction I have suggested is popularly recognized when we say that
science is experimental or depends upon elaborate observational researches,
whereas philosophy is really armchair thinking.

Both philosophers and scientists must observe and think, but they think about
different sorts of observation; the scientist must make his observations
under special conditions, while the philosopher may think about his ordinary
experience.

The difference in method always reveals itself in philosophical and scientific
books, and that is how you can tell which sorts of book you are reading.

.. 158

Different kinds of books require different kinds of learnings
=============================================================

As books differ in the kinds of knowledge they have to communicate, they
proceed to instruct us differently. If we are to follow them, we must learn
to read each kind in an appropriate manner.

Scientists and philosophers do not think in exactly the same way. Their styles
in arguing are different.


.. 160

*******************
Seeing the skeleton
*******************

`Talk on how fear of analysis destroying literature is unfounded.`


.. _rule 1.2:

Rule 1.2: |rule 1.2|
====================

State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most in several
sentences (a short paragraph). (162)

You must be able to say what the whole book is about as briefly as possible.

By "about" we don't mean the subject matter (what _kind_ of book it is); we mean its _theme_ or main _point_.

A good story (e.g. Homer) has a single unity of action, a main thread of plots which ties everything together; the rest is episode. Once you know the main plot, you can put the parts into their proper places.

    This book is about the nature of reading in general, the various kinds of reading, and the relation of the art of reading to the art of being taught in school and out. It considers, therefore, the serious consequences of the neglect of reading in the contemporary education, suggesting as a solution that books can be substituted for living teachers if individuals can help themselves learn how to read.

.. _rule 1.3:

Rule 1.3: |rule 1.3|
====================

Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a
whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole. (163)

reason: you have not grasped a complex unity if all you know about it is how it is one.

A good book, like a good house, is an orderly arrangement of parts.

`Great books`_ are the most readable partly because they have the most
intelligible structure, despite greater complexity.

.. _rule 1.4:

Rule 1.4: |rule 1.4|
====================

Find out what the author's problems were (183) or
Define the problems the author is trying to solve (185)

***************
Coming to terms
***************

`185`


Communication
    An effort on the part of one man to share some with another: his knowledge,
    his decisions, his sentiments.
    
Communication succeeds only when it results in a common something, as an item
of knowledge which two men have in common.

.. _rule 2.1:

Rule 2.1: |rule 2.1|
====================

Find the most important words and through them come to terms with the author. (187)

Note that the rule has two parts.

1. Locate the words which make a difference
   2. Determine their meanings, as used, with precision

******************************
What's the proposition and why
******************************

`209`

.. _rule 2.2:

Rule 2.2: |rule 2.2|
====================

.. _rule 2.3:

Rule 2.3: |rule 2.3|
====================

Find if you can the paragraphs in a book which state its important arguments;
but if the argument are not thus expressed, your task is `construct` them, by
taking a sentence from this paragraph, and one from that, until you have
gathered together the sequence of sentences which the state the propositions
that composed the argument.

.. tip::

   Remember that every argument must involve a number of statements. Of these,
   some give the reasons why you should accept a conclusion the author is
   proposing. If you find find the conclusions first, then look for the
   reasons. If you find the reasons first, see what they lead to. (231)

.. tip::

   Discriminate between the kind of argument which points to one or more
   particular facts as evidence for some generalization and the kind which
   offers a series of general statements to prove some further generalizations.

   General propositions which are called self-evident, or axioms, are
   propositions we know to be true as soon as we understand their terms. Such
   propositions are ultimately derived from our experience of particulars. (231)

.. tip::

   Observe:
   
   - what things the author says he must assume
   - what he says can be proved or otherwise evidenced
   - what need not be proved because it is self-evident

Rule 2.4: |rule 2.4|
====================

*********************************
The etiquette of talking back
*********************************

`235`

Reading a book is a kind of conversation. The reader has the last word, but
the reader must not be judge before reading fully because the author cannot
defend himself.

    Ordinary conversations between persons who confront each other are good
    only when they are carried on decently. I am not thinking merely of the
    decencies according to conventions of social politeness. There is in
    addition, an intellectual etiquette one should observe. Without it,
    conversation is bickering rather than profitable communication. I am
    assuming here, of course, that the conversation is about a serious matter
    on which men can agree or disagree. Then it becomes important that they
    conduct themselves well. Otherwise there is no profit in the enterprise.
    The profit in good conversation is something learned.

TODO

----

Are you reading for information or understanding?

Heuristic: Anything easily digested is reading for information

*   Newspaper

Claim: not really learning anything new

You need to find writers who are more knowledgable on a particular subject than yourself.

Mortimery Adler wrote the book on reading in "How to Read a Book". Identified four levels of reading:

1.  Elementary

    The level of reading taught in our elementary schools.

2.  Inspectional

    Inspectional reading allows us to look at the authors blueprint and evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience

    There are two types of inspectional reading:

    1.  Systematic skimming

        This is meant to be a quick check of the book by:

        1.  Reading the preface
        2.  Studying the table of contents
        3.  Checking the index
        4.  Reading the inside jacket

        This should give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in the book pivotal to the authors argument.

        Skimming helps you reach a decision point: Does this book deserve more of my time and attention?

    2.  Superficial reading

3.  Analytical

    Analytical reading is a thorough reading; the best you can do given an unlimited time.

    Rules to analytic reading:

    -   Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
    -   State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity
    -   Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole
    -   Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve

    Though these may sound easy, they involve a lot of work.

    When you're done this, you may understand the book but not the broader subject. To do this, you need to use comparative reading to synthesize knowledge from several books on the same subject.

4.  Syntopical

    This is also known as comparative reading and it represents the most demanding and difficult reading of all.

    Syntopical reading involves reading many books on the same subject and comparing and contrasting ideas.

    There are five steps to syntopical reading:

    1. Find the relevant passages
    2. Bring the author to terms
    3. Get the questions clear
    4. Define the issues
    5. Analyze the discussion

These are thought of as levels because you can't move to a higher level without a firm understanding of the previous one.

The goal of reading determines how you read. The goal of reading a romance novel is different from reading the newspaper which is different from reading Plato.

.. _criticism:

Criticism
    To judge whether what is being offered is really acceptable as knowledge

.. 132
.. _fine art:
.. _fine arts:

Fine art
    Art in which the artist aims to please or delight by making beautiful
    things to be beheld

    Roughly, poetry.

    *focus* beauty, narrative writing

.. _complex skill:
.. _complex skills:

Complex skill
    A skill which depends on many other simpler skills in order to be performed
    effectively.

    During the acquisition of a complex skill, each of its component skills
    must be done separately and consciously, but they can be done together
    and unconsciously when we are expert.

    *example* tennis, driving a car, reading

.. 129
.. _extrinsic:
.. _extrinsic reading:

Extrinsic reading
    Reading a book in the light of other books.

    Other books may be only reference books, secondary books or other great books.

    We may also necessarily use relevant experience as an extrinsic aid.

.. _great book:
.. _great books:
.. _great work:
.. _great works:

Great work
    pass

.. 129
.. _intrinsic:
.. _intrinsic reading:

Intrinsic reading
    Reading a book in itself, apart from all other books.

.. _learning_curve:

Learning curve
    A graphical representation of a person's skill versus their experience,
    which is typically curved due to improvement in skill becoming harder as
    experience increases.

.. _learning_plateau:

Learning plateau
    A span of time in which a learner's skill remains constant despite
    additional experienced.
    
    Learning plateaus are not found in all learning curves, but only in those
    which record progress in gaining a `complex skill`_. The more complex the
    skill, the more frequently learning plateaus appear.

    Learning goes on during learning plateaus, but it does not manifest as
    an improvement in skill.
    
    One explanation is that during a learning plateau the learner combines
    simple acts into a complex one, and only when he has mastered the complex
    act does his skill visibly improve. Thus, in order to perform a complex act
    (like reading or playing tennis) one needs to master each of its component 
    acts (such that they become automatic), and then master them in
    combination. (One cannot think about beating one's opponent in tennis
    until one can reliably return a ball.)

.. 132
.. _liberal art:
.. _liberal arts:

Liberal art
    Art in which the artist aims to instruct by speaking the truth

    Roughly, science.

    *focus* truth, expository writing

.. _obscurantism:

Obscurantism
    The error of supposing that all books can be read in only one way.

    There are two extremes:

    1.  Of estheticism, which regards all books as if they were poetry
    2.  Of intellectualism, which treats all books as if they were instructive

.. _purism:

Purism
    The error of supposing that a given book can be read in only one way.

    It is an error because books are not pure in character, and that in turn
    is due to the fact that the human mind, which writes or reads them, is
    rooted in the senses and imagination and moves or is moved by emotion
    and sentiment.

.. 123
.. _understanding:

Understanding
    To grasp what is being offered as knowledge

    To understand some thing, one must approach it:

    1. First, as a whole, having unity and a structure of parts
    2. Second, in terms of its elements, its units of language and thought
