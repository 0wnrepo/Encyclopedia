This is a book for readers who cannot read.

There are many kinds of reading and degrees of ability to read.

This book is for readers who want to read better or want to read in some other way than they now can.

This book is for people who cannot read at all (e.g. infants, imbeciles) and masters.

    Most of us know that we are are not expert reader. We know this in many ways, but most obviously when we find some things too difficult to read, or have great trouble in reading them; or when someone else has read the same thing we have and shown us how much we missed or misunderstood... Most of us have experienced difficulties in reading, but we do not know why we have trouble or what to do about it.

    I think this is because most of us do not regard reading as a complicated activity, involving many different steps in each of which we can acquire more and more skill through practice, as in the case of any other art. We may not even think there is an art of reading. We tend to think of reading almost as if it were something as simple and natural to do as looking or walking. There is no art of looking or walking. 


    I told him that this book was like a book on how to play tennis.

    As written about in books, the art of tennis consists of rules for making each of the various strokes, a discussion of how and when to use them, and a description of how to organize these parts into the general strategy of a successful game. The art of reading has to be written about in the same way. There are rules for each of the different steps you must take to complete the reading of a whole book.

Knowing how to read well was like any other art or skill.

    For every illusion that the classroom can nourish, there is a school  of hard knocks to destroy it.

    Here I wish only to record this fact about our schools, a fact which concerns us all, because in large part they have made us what we are today—people who cannot read well enough to enjoy reading for profit or profit by reading for enjoyment. (11)

    But education does not stop with schooling, nor does the responsibility for the ultimate educational fate of each of us rest entirely on the school system. Everyone can and must decide for himself whether he is satisfied with the education he got, or is now getting if he is still in school. If he is not satisfied, it is up to him to do something about it. With schools as they are, more schooling is hardly the remedy. One way out—perhaps the only one available to most people—is to learn to read better, and then, by reading better, to learn more of what can be learned through reading. (11)

From many rules to one habit

:Abstract: 
    Reading is a `complex skill`_.

    Reading is either intrinsic_ or extrinsic_.
    
    Intrinsic reading consists of understanding_ and criticism_.

    Understanding_ consists of analysis and synthesis.

Three ways of reading
=====================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

.. 124

A good book deserves three readings.

1.  Understanding_

    1. Analytic Reading
    2. Synthetic Reading

2.  Critical

    3. Critical Reading

These three readings are not three in time, but three in manner: three ways of
reading a book.

The first two readings are reading for understanding. As a reader becomes
expert, these may be performed simultaneously. The third is distinct, as a
reader must understand an author before criticizing him.

The first two readings and the third must be done somewhat separately;
understanding the author must always precede criticizing or judging him.

.. 126

    If you had to check your reading of a book, you would have to divide the
    whole process into its parts. You might have to re-examine separately each
    step you took, though at the time you did not take it separately, so
    habitual had the process of reading become.

.. 127

    The teacher of English composition, going over a paper with a student and
    explaining his marks, points to this or that rule the student violated. At
    that time, the student must be reminded of the different rules, but the
    teacher does not want him to write with a rule sheet before him. He wants
    him to write well habitually, as if the rules were part of his nature. The
    same is true of reading.


.. _reading_1:

Reading 1: |reading 1|
----------------------

Here the reader proceeds from the whole to its parts.

Rules for the first reading:

#. |rule 1.1|_
#. |rule 1.2|_
#. |rule 1.3|_
#. |rule 1.4|_

Knowing `what the whole book is about <rule 1.2_>`_ and `what its main
divisions are <rule 1.3_>`_ will help you discover its leading terms and
propositions. If you can discover what the chief contentions of the author are
and how he supports these by arguments and evidence, you will be aided in
determine the general tenor his treatment and its major divisions.

.. _reading 2:
.. _reading interpretative:
.. _reading synthetic:
.. |reading 2| replace:: The interpretation of a book's contents

Reading 2: |reading 2|
----------------------

Here the reader proceeds from the parts to the whole.

The reader focuses on terms, propositions, and syllogisms; the author's ideas,
assertions, and arguments.

Rules for the second reading:

#. |rule 2.1|
#. |rule 2.2|
#. |rule 2.3|
#. |rule 2.4|

.. _reading_3:
.. _reading_critical:
.. _reading_evaluative:

Reading 3: |reading 3|
----------------------

Here the reader judges the author, and decides whether he agrees or disagrees.

.. At this point we have seen rules 1.1, 

Intrinsic reading & Extrinsic reading
=====================================

We distinguish between:

#. `intrinsic reading`_
#. `extrinsic reading`_

.. 127

Rule 0:
    |rule 0|

If authors are agreeing or disagreeing, one cannot be assured one understands
one of them unless they recognize such agreements and disagreements.

This applies especially to the `great books`_-- many of them are
difficult to read because they are related and have been written in a certain
order, such that reading earlier books may help understanding later books.

*see* `chapter 14`_

Rules of `extrinsic reading`_:

1.  Read related books in relation to each other and in an order which renders
    the later ones more intelligible


Criteria for rules of intrinsic reading
=======================================

1. The rules of intrinsic reading also apply to lectures
2. The rules only apply to reading a `whole` book, not to excerpts
3. The rules only apply to liberal arts, not fine arts

.. 129

The rules of intrinsic reading also apply to lectures
------------------------------------------------------

The rules of `intrinsic reading`_ apply equally to reading a book and to taking
a course of lectures.

Lectures require more expertise from users to be profitable:

-   Lectures require a greater exercise of memory or note taking than books
-   Books may be reexamined


.. 130

The rules only apply to reading a `whole` book, not to excerpts
---------------------------------------------------------------

The primary aim of these rules is to help you read a whole book; they would be
misused if applied mainly to excepts or small parts out of context.

One should not read small pieces spaced over time:

- Excerpts are far too short for a sustained effort of reading.
- The order in which excerpts are read make it impossible to grasp and real
  whole concept in itself or to understand one thing in relation to another.

.. TODO: This is extremely hazy and should be revised.


.. 132

Fine arts & Liberal arts
========================

We distinguish between two large classes of books: `fine art`_ and
`liberal art`_ which differ on:

1. Intention of the author
2. The satisfaction its afford readers

`Fine arts`_ and `liberal arts`_ require different `complex skills`_ to
appreciate. Both skills are necessary for decent literacy since few books fit
neatly into either class, and many `great books`_ intentionally do not. [#]_

.. 135

Books which treat of the appreciation or criticism of `fine art`_ are themselves
`liberal arts`_. [#]_ After reading this book you can read those and learn how
to read the other way. In general, you will find the greatest help from those
books which formulate the rules and exemplify them in practice. [#]_

.. 137

Read books with a purpose
=========================

One should satisfy one's purpose by going to a book written with a similar
intention, but know the same book can be read in different ways and according
to different purposes (do not make the mistakes of `purism`_ or `obscurantism`_).
The author may have had more than one intention, although one is likely to be
primary and dictate the obvious character of the book. Whatever you do in the
way of reading, you must know what you are doing and obey the rules for doing
that sort of things. There is no error in reading a poem as if it were
philosophy so long as you know which you are doing at a given time and how to
do it well. 

.. 140

**************************
Catching on from the title
**************************

:Abstract:
    It is important to know what kind of book one is reading before reading it
    because different kinds of books cannot be read in the same way. The
    primary kinds of `expository books`_ are `theoretical books`_ and
    `practical books`_. One may further classify `theoretical books`_  as
    `history`_, `science`_, or `philosophy`_. One can usually classify a book
    before reading it by reading it `front matter`_. One can identify specific
    kinds of books with specific rules.

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

.. 141
.. _rule 1.1:
.. |rule 1.1| replace:: Classify the book according to kind and subject matter

Rule 1.1: |rule 1.1|
====================

*You must know what kind of (`expository`_) book you are reading, and you should
know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to
read*

.. 158

This is because different `kinds of books`_ exist, which each have different
kinds of knowledge to communicate and different problems to solve, which
require different methods to solve and different methods of writing to explain,
which require different kinds of reading to follow. If a reader does not know
the kind of book he is reading, he will become perplexed and he may be unable
to ask or answer a large number of questions about the book.

.. 147

Kinds of books
==============

A good reader must not only be able to classify books as the same kind, he
also needs to know what kinds there are. Many schemes of classification
exist, but we need one which groups books with an eye to the problems of
reading, and not for the purpose of selling them or putting them on shelves.
We primarily classify `expository books`_ as `theoretical`_ or `practical`_
and may further classify `theoretical books`_  as `history`_, `science`_, or 
`philosophy`_. [#]_


How to classify books
=====================

One often can classify a book by studying its `front matter`_. This is
preferable to classifying a book by reading it, since it is useful to know what
kinds of book one is reading before reading. Be aware that front matter may be
misleading, and that some books cannot be neatly classified, often because
unskilled authors are unaware of distinctions.

.. 149

Practical books can be identified by noticing "the art of", "how to", or the
names of practical fields (such as  economics, ethics, and politics) in the
title, identifying it as a manual, guidebook, oration, political speech, or
moral treatise, identifying persuasive writing, noticing it tells you either
what you `should` do or `how` to do it, and noticing frequent occurrence of
such words as "should", "ought", "good", "bad", "ends", "means", "better",
"worse", "right", and "wrong".

`History`_ books can usually be identified by spotting "history" in the title
or being informed by the front matter that a book is about the past. `Science`_
and `philosophy`_ books are harder to identify because they are easy to mistake
for each other since both have titles that are the name of the subject matter
that they deal with, both seek general truths, and both claim frequently claim
the same subjects. Roughly though, if a `theoretical book`_ refers to things
which lie outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily experience, it is
scientific, otherwise it is philosophical, since science requires special
observation for support which requires elaborate experiments, but philosophy
needs only common observations ("armchair thinking").

.. _rule 1.2:

Rule 1.2: |rule 1.2|
====================

State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most in several
sentences (a short paragraph). (162)

You must be able to say what the whole book is about as briefly as possible.

By "about" we don't mean the subject matter (what _kind_ of book it is); we mean its _theme_ or main _point_.

A good story (e.g. Homer) has a single unity of action, a main thread of plots which ties everything together; the rest is episode. Once you know the main plot, you can put the parts into their proper places.

    This book is about the nature of reading in general, the various kinds of reading, and the relation of the art of reading to the art of being taught in school and out. It considers, therefore, the serious consequences of the neglect of reading in the contemporary education, suggesting as a solution that books can be substituted for living teachers if individuals can help themselves learn how to read.

.. _rule 1.3:

Rule 1.3: |rule 1.3|
====================

Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a
whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole. (163)

reason: you have not grasped a complex unity if all you know about it is how it is one.

A good book, like a good house, is an orderly arrangement of parts.

`Great books`_ are the most readable partly because they have the most
intelligible structure, despite greater complexity.

.. _rule 1.4:

Rule 1.4: |rule 1.4|
====================

Find out what the author's problems were (183) or
Define the problems the author is trying to solve (185)

***************
Coming to terms
***************

`185`


Communication
    An effort on the part of one man to share some with another: his knowledge,
    his decisions, his sentiments.
    
Communication succeeds only when it results in a common something, as an item
of knowledge which two men have in common.

.. _rule 2.1:

Rule 2.1: |rule 2.1|
====================

Find the most important words and through them come to terms with the author. (187)

Note that the rule has two parts.

1. Locate the words which make a difference
   2. Determine their meanings, as used, with precision

******************************
What's the proposition and why
******************************

`209`

.. _rule 2.2:

Rule 2.2: |rule 2.2|
====================

.. _rule 2.3:

Rule 2.3: |rule 2.3|
====================

Find if you can the paragraphs in a book which state its important arguments;
but if the argument are not thus expressed, your task is `construct` them, by
taking a sentence from this paragraph, and one from that, until you have
gathered together the sequence of sentences which the state the propositions
that composed the argument.

.. tip::

   Remember that every argument must involve a number of statements. Of these,
   some give the reasons why you should accept a conclusion the author is
   proposing. If you find find the conclusions first, then look for the
   reasons. If you find the reasons first, see what they lead to. (231)

.. tip::

   Discriminate between the kind of argument which points to one or more
   particular facts as evidence for some generalization and the kind which
   offers a series of general statements to prove some further generalizations.

   General propositions which are called self-evident, or axioms, are
   propositions we know to be true as soon as we understand their terms. Such
   propositions are ultimately derived from our experience of particulars. (231)

.. tip::

   Observe:
   
   - what things the author says he must assume
   - what he says can be proved or otherwise evidenced
   - what need not be proved because it is self-evident

Rule 2.4: |rule 2.4|
====================

*********************************
The etiquette of talking back
*********************************

`235`

Reading a book is a kind of conversation. The reader has the last word, but
the reader must not be judge before reading fully because the author cannot
defend himself.

    Ordinary conversations between persons who confront each other are good
    only when they are carried on decently. I am not thinking merely of the
    decencies according to conventions of social politeness. There is in
    addition, an intellectual etiquette one should observe. Without it,
    conversation is bickering rather than profitable communication. I am
    assuming here, of course, that the conversation is about a serious matter
    on which men can agree or disagree. Then it becomes important that they
    conduct themselves well. Otherwise there is no profit in the enterprise.
    The profit in good conversation is something learned.

----

Are you reading for information or understanding?

Heuristic: Anything easily digested is reading for information

*   Newspaper

Claim: not really learning anything new

You need to find writers who are more knowledgable on a particular subject than yourself.

Mortimery Adler wrote the book on reading in "How to Read a Book". Identified four levels of reading:

1.  Elementary

    The level of reading taught in our elementary schools.

2.  Inspectional

    Inspectional reading allows us to look at the authors blueprint and evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience

    There are two types of inspectional reading:

    1.  Systematic skimming

        This is meant to be a quick check of the book by:

        1.  Reading the preface
        2.  Studying the table of contents
        3.  Checking the index
        4.  Reading the inside jacket

        This should give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in the book pivotal to the authors argument.

        Skimming helps you reach a decision point: Does this book deserve more of my time and attention?

    2.  Superficial reading

3.  Analytical

    Analytical reading is a thorough reading; the best you can do given an unlimited time.

    Rules to analytic reading:

    -   Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
    -   State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity
    -   Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole
    -   Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve

    Though these may sound easy, they involve a lot of work.

    When you're done this, you may understand the book but not the broader subject. To do this, you need to use comparative reading to synthesize knowledge from several books on the same subject.

4.  Syntopical

    This is also known as comparative reading and it represents the most demanding and difficult reading of all.

    Syntopical reading involves reading many books on the same subject and comparing and contrasting ideas.

    There are five steps to syntopical reading:

    1. Find the relevant passages
    2. Bring the author to terms
    3. Get the questions clear
    4. Define the issues
    5. Analyze the discussion

These are thought of as levels because you can't move to a higher level without a firm understanding of the previous one.

The goal of reading determines how you read. The goal of reading a romance novel is different from reading the newspaper which is different from reading Plato.

History
    History is knowledge of particular events or things which not only existed

    The historian narrates these happenings and often colors his narrative
    with some comment on, or insight into, the significance of the events.

.. _intrinsic:
.. _intrinsic reading:

Intrinsic reading
    Reading a book in itself, apart from all other books.

.. _learning_curve:

Learning curve
    A graphical representation of a person's skill versus their experience,
    which is typically curved due to improvement in skill becoming harder as
    experience increases.

.. _learning_plateau:

Learning plateau
    A span of time in which a learner's skill remains constant despite
    additional experienced.
    
    Learning plateaus are not found in all learning curves, but only in those
    which record progress in gaining a `complex skill`_. The more complex the
    skill, the more frequently learning plateaus appear.

    Learning goes on during learning plateaus, but it does not manifest as
    an improvement in skill.
    
    One explanation is that during a learning plateau the learner combines
    simple acts into a complex one, and only when he has mastered the complex
    act does his skill visibly improve. Thus, in order to perform a complex act
    (like reading or playing tennis) one needs to master each of its component 
    acts (such that they become automatic), and then master them in
    combination. (One cannot think about beating one's opponent in tennis
    until one can reliably return a ball.)

Obscurantism
    The error of supposing that all books can be read in only one way.

Purism
    The error of supposing that a given book can be read in only one way.

    It is an error because books are not pure in character, and that in turn
    is due to the fact that the human mind, which writes or reads them, is
    rooted in the senses and imagination and moves or is moved by emotion
    and sentiment.

    Science treat of matters that can happen at any time or place.

    Scientists seek laws or generalizations.

    Scientists seek to find out how things happen for the most part or in
    ever case.

    The rules of extrinsic reading are more complicated in the case of scientific

    your imagination to construct something as you have never observed.
