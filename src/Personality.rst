Introversion & Extroversion
================================================================================

Introverts experience sensations more intensely and need less of an experience
as a result.

In study after study, positive-psychology researchers have shown that
extroversion is highly correlated with greater happiness and life satisfaction.
Extroverts are simply more likely to seek out the experiences that create social
bonding and affection. As a result, they are better liked and better supported
than introverts, two measures that factor heavily into quality of life.
Introverts want to be liked and appreciated, and they need help just as much as
anyone else; they're just not as motivated to seek out opportunities to build up
that kind of positive social feeling and exchange.
