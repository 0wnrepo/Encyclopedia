Aristotle
================================================================================

:Born: 384 BC
:Died: 322 BC (aged 62)

Aristotle was a philosopher.

At the age of 18, Aristotle joined `Plato's Academy`_ in Athens_ and remained
there until the age of 37, around 347 BC.

Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens.

Around 335 BC, Aristotle (aged 50) returned to Athens and began teaching at the
Lyceum.

With the request of Philip of Macedonia, Aristotle became a tutor for Alexander
in 356-323 BC.

Aristotle achieved merit through teaching Alexander the great.

Aristotle's view on the physical sciences profoundly shaped medieval
scholarship, and their influence extended well into the Renaissance until they
were replaced by Newtonian physics.

The Peripatetic school
================================================================================

The peripatetic school was an informal institution whose members conducted
philosophical and scientific inquiries, so called because Aristotle had the
habit of teaching while walking.
