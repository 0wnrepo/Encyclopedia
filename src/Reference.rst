# Theory of reference 

# Direct reference theory (Referentialism)

A direct reference theory is a theory of language that claims:

- The meaning of a word lies in what it points out in the world

# History

John Stuart Mill was one of the earliest modern advocates of a direct theory beginning in 1843.

In 'A System of Logic', Mill introduced a distinction between connotation and denotation.

Connotation is a relation between a name and one more more attributes.

Example: "Widow" denotes widows and connotes the attribute of being female and of having been married to someone who is now dead.

If a name is connotative, its denotation is in virtue of objects predicable of the attributes it connotes. Connotation thus determines denotation.

A name can have connotation but no denotation.

According to Mill, connotation of a name can be taken to be its meaning.

In the 19th century, Frege argued against the direct reference theory.
