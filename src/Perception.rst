Perception
=================================================================================

**Perception** is the organization, identification, and interpretation of
sensory information.

Perception is not the passive receipt of signals, but is shaped by learning,
memory_, expectation, and attention_.

Perception involves top-down processes and bottom-up processes of processing
sensory input. The bottom-up processes transform low-level information to
higher-level information (e.g. extra shapes for object recognition). The
top-down processing refers to a person's concept and expectations and selective
mechanisms that influence perception.

The `perceptual systems` of the brain enable individuals to perceive the
environment as stable, even though the sensory information is typically
incomplete and rapidly varying.

Process
=================================================================================

An example would be a person looking at a shoe. The shoe itself is the `distal
object`_. When light from the shoe enters a person's eye and stimulates their
retina, that stimulation is the `proximal stimulus`_. The image of the shoe
reconstructed by the brain of the person is the percept_.
