Information
================================================================================

Information is a sequence of symbols that can be interpreted as a message.

The unit of measure of information is the bit ("binary digit").

The number of bits in a signal is equal to log_2 number of possibilities; the
number of binary questions that would need to asked to identify a letter in an
alphabet (assuming probabilities are equal).
