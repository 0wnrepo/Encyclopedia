================================================================================
Screening
================================================================================

Screening is the process of combating `adverse selection`_ to determine who to
extend offers to.

Motivation
================================================================================

# Hypothesis

There are two forms of hypotheses that we are interested in:

- The null hypothesis: the expected result of the experiment

- The alternative hypothesis: the result we are interested in showing support
  for

The two are mutually exclusive and exhaustive of the possibility.

Formally stated, the central task of screening is falsifying the proposition
that the candidate is qualified for the position.

Our null hypothesis is that the candidate succeeds due to chance effects.

Our alternative hypothesis is that the candidate succeeds due to truly being
qualified.

In that sense, tests are ultimately designed to determine if the candidate is unqualified, and a single red flag could compromise a candidate's chances.

Methodology
================================================================================

Conducting a screen involves two parts:

1. Observation: data collection
2. Analysis: understanding data

Candidates can be screened through a number of methods:

- Manual inspection, for example, test driving a new car, free samples, and free trials.
- Demonstration, for example, infomercials, door-to-door salesmen, mathematical proofs.
- Reputation, for example, brands, repeat business.
- Unsolicited reviews, for example, early adopters, celebrity endorsements, movie critics, and consumer reviews.
- Certification, for example, prestigious schools, standardized tests, government IDs, licensing, diplomas, the Nobel Prize.
- Guarantees, for examples, warranties, contracts, exchanging secrets, oaths.

Each of these techniques reduces risk through various mechanisms:

- Inspection is only be useful if the inspector can accurately assess the quality of a good.
- Demonstration reduces risk by providing repeatable or unquestionable results.
- Reputation reduces risk by indicating above-average quality and proving the consumers a mean of retaliation if quality does not meet expectations.
- Reviews reduce risk via crowdfunding trust capital.
- Certification reduces risk by borrowing trust capital from another entity.
- Guarantees reduce risk by backing trust capital with financial capital; risk is borne by the seller rather than the buyer.

## What makes a screen good?

A good study ranks highly on each of the following criteria:

1. Morality: the degree to which a study respects ethical standards
2. Economy: the cost of a study
3. Validity: the degree to which a study answers the questions it intends to answer (for example a educational test)
4. Reliability: the degree to which a study gives consistent results
5. Generalizability: the degree to which a study can generalize its findings to larger populations

In practice, researchers routinely make tradeoffs, for instance, compromising rigor to reduce costs, or have enough control over the environment to ensure there are no confounding variables and ensuring results can be generalized to everyday life.

### Validity

In the area of scientific research design and experimentation, validity is the extent to which a study scientifically answers the questions it is intended to answer.

In medicine: "False positives"

#### Internal Validity

Internal validity is the extent to which casual inferences of a study are warranted.

Such warrant is constituted by the extent to which a study minimizes systematic error (or 'bias').

Inferences are said to possess internal validity if a causal relation between two variables is properly demonstrated.

Indicators of high internal validity include:

- Respondent validiation ("member checks")

Indicators of low internal validity include:

- Confounding variables
- Selection bias
- History
- Maturation
- Repeated testing
- Instrument change
- Regression toward the mean
- Mortality
- Selection-maturation interaction
- Diffusion
- Compensatory rivalry/resentful demoralization
- Experimenter bias

#### External Validity (Generalizability)

External validity is the extent to which generalizability of the results of a study is warranted.

There are two kind of generalizability:

- Across situations: The extent to which we can generalize from the situation constructed by an experimenter to real-life situations.
- Across people: The extent to which we can generalize from the people who participated in the experiment to people in general.

Indicators of high external validity include:

- Mundane realism: The extent to which an experiment is similar to a real-life situation. Field experiments possess high mundane realism.
- Psychological realism: The extent to which the psychological processes triggered in an experiment are similar to psychological processes that occur in real-life situations. Self-reported behavioral predications possess low mundane realism.
- Random population: Subjects in experiments are randomly chosen.
- Replication: conducting the study over again, generally with different subject populations or in different settings.
- Meta-analysis: The extent to which the results of similar but unique studies corroborate.

Indicators of low external validity include:

- Aptitude-treatment interaction:
- Situation: That an experiment is conducted in a specific environment limits generalizability.
- Pre-test effects: 
- Post-test effects
- Reactivity: Difference in subject behavior may be a result of the subject being aware of the observer, the subject's expectation of the treatment, or novelty, rather than because of treatment.
- Rosenthal effects: Interviewer expectations for the candidate risk self-fulfilling prophecies.

## Observation (Data Collection)

Observation may be classified as either:

1. Participant observation: observation with interaction with the people one observes
2. Non-participant observation: observation without interaction with the people one observes

The most common method is the qualitative research interview, but forms of the data collected can also include group discussions, observation and reflection field notes, various texts, pictures, and other materials.

### Non-participant observation

Non-participant observation is observation with limited interaction with the people one observes.  For example, some observational data can be collected unobtrusively (e.g. worn out carpet as indicators of high use areas in a physical setting). 

#### Motivation

When studying social phenomenon, researchers collect and analyze texts and artifacts produced and used by members of the target populate to foster understanding.

Non-participant observation:

- Lacks insight into the meaning of the social context studied
- Provides researchers a way to study objects under observation in fine-detail which would otherwise be impossible to measure in a field setting (for instance, the ability measure intonation of speech).

### Participant observation

#### Motivation

Immersion and prolonged involvement in a setting can lead to the development of rapport and foster free and open speaking with members. 

# Results (Outline of Techniques Used)

The order in which a company performs screens is very important.

Generally speaking, screens should be ordered in a way that minimizes cost. However, screens are not independent of each other. On one hand, a candidate who fails a screen does not continue with the rest. On the other hand, a candidate who passes a screen increases confidence of quality in subsequent interviews.

Generally, three techniques are used to screen companies:

- Resumes
- Assignments
- Interviews

### Resumes

Pros:

- Low cost
- High reliability

Cons:

- Low validity
- Low generalizability

#### Methodology

Companies use resumes to decide who to interview.

Candidates should use a resume to signal value.

A resume may indicate intelligence and productivity via a variety of signals:

- Pre-selection, through selective institutions (e.g top schools, employment at selective companies, athletes, marines)
- High GPA, high standardized test scores, honor societies
- Extra-curricular programming (participation in programming contests, side projects)
- Jobs with computers going back to an early age
- Open-source contributions
- Familiarity with leading edge technology
- Technically challenging accomplishments
- Effective communication
    - Bullets should be from most important to least important
    - Bullets should say what candidates did, not what role they had, hence the active voice
    - Bullets should be as specific as possible, ideally quantifiable
    - Buzzwords are used for keyword index driven nature of job world

Note, there are a number of things which candidates should not include on resumes.

### Take-homes

#### Motivation

Pros:

- Low cost
- High generalizability

Cons:

- Low validity
- Low reliability


### Interviews

TODO: Did Microsoft invent the technical interview?

An interview is a conversation between two or more people where questions are asked by the interviewer to elicit facts and statements from the interviewee.

#### Motivation

Interviews are used to understand the meaning of what interviewees say.

Interviews are time consuming and resource intensive. Less expensive screens should be used before interviews to avoid expense on candidates who would have been filtered by earlier and cheaper processes.

Consequently, candidates who make it to the interview stage are generally high quality candidates and interviews are reserved for fine distinguishing.

#### Methodology

Interviewing involves asking questions and getting answers from respondents.

The asking and answering of questions can be mediated by the telephone or other electronic devices (e.g. computers).

Interviews may be:

- Structured Interviews
    - Closed question
    - Pre-set questions
    - Pre-coding of answers
    - Quantitative analysis possible
    - Easy to maintain control of interview
- Unstructured Interviews
    - Open questions
    - Pre-set area of investigation
    - Little or no precoding possible
    - Quantitative analysis not possible
    - Good interviewing skills required to maintain control of interview
- Informal Interviews
- Focus Groups

The type of interview that best suits your investigation is completely dependent upon several factors such as what your research objectives are, the budget available to you and any pending time limits and deadlines. Another important consideration is what kind of data you hope to yield as a result of your investigation.

An open question allows the respondent to give a full answer to a question with as much explanation as they choose. Generally, open questions can only be answered with some supporting explanation. Whereas a closed question requires a simple, usually one worded response such as yes or no, or offers a list from which the respondent can choose a response. It does not allow the respondent to expand upon their answer or to explain why they made that choice.

1. Introducing questions

How will you get the interview started? If the interview is opened well and the interviewee speaks freely, then the remainder of the interview can be spent clarifying and following up on any interesting points raised.

- 'Can you tell me about....'

2. Follow-up questions

These questions are used to extend the interviewee's answers to previous questions. The trick is to listen to what is important to the interviewee but to keep in mind your research questions at all times.

- 'could you expand on that point.'
- 'You mentioned that....how did you feel about it.'
- 'Right'

3. Probing questions

The interviewer probes the content of the interviewee's answers but without giving away which parts of the answers are to be taken into account.

- 'Do you have further examples of this?'
- 'Could you say something more about that.'

4. Specifying questions

The interviewer asks questions that will allow them to gain further information about a particular aspect of the interviewee's answer.

If the interviewee has given fairly generalised answers, a specifying question could be used to personalise the answer.

- 'What did you think then?'
- 'Have you experienced this yourself?'

5. Direction questions

The interviewer asks very direct questions, often used in the later parts of the interview.

- 'Have you ever received money for achieving good grades?'
- 'When you mention competition, do you then think of a sportsman like or a destructive competition?'

6. Indirect questions

The interviewer asks projective questions. Care should be taken to ensure that the answer is interpreted correctly in this situation. Further questions may be required to determine exactly what the interviewee means.
- 'How do you believe other pupils regard the competition for grades?'

7. Structuring questions

The interviewer needs to ensure that those areas relevant to the research question are covered during the course of the interview and can use questions to structure the interview accordingly.

'I would now like to introduce a new topic: ...'

8. Silence

Silence can be a useful tool in furthering the interview. It allows interviewee's a chance to reflect on what has been discussed. They may then be able to offer more information.

9. Interpreting questions

How or to what degree you interpret a question may involve rephrasing the answer and putting it to the interviewee or attempting to clarify their answer.

- You meant that...?
- Is it correct that you feel that?

Another type of question that you may have heard of is a 'leading question'. A leading question can be defined as 'a question that you ask in a particular way in order to get the answer you want' (Oxford English Dictionary 2006). These should be avoided as they can obviously have an adverse effect on your results.

Active listening:

Active listening involves attentive listening that listens not only to the words being said but also to the tone and emphasis. If you are listening actively you will be able to pick up any new or significant themes contained within your interviewee's response. Additionally, you will be able to make sure that the interviewee gives a full explanation.


A technical interview typically has four parts:

1. Introduction and discussion of work
2. Pointer/Recursion question
3. Analysis
4. Do you have any questions?

Each phase has a specific purpose:

1. The introduction and discussion of the candidate's work is intended to:
    - Relax the candidate. Offer refreshments, introduce yourself, welcome and thank the participant, and ensure they feel comfortable. Explain the purpose of the interview, the importance of the their views and experience, assure confidentiality, and ask permission to record if appropriate.
    - Confirm claims on the candidate's resume
    - Discusses projects to gage passion and communication abilities
    - Discusses employment history to understand how the candidate has handled problems in the past
2. The pointer/recursion question is intended to:
    - Discern programming aptitude.
    - Be a pretext to have a conversation on a difficult subject so that the interviewer's judgment can form an opinion on whether the person is smart.
3. The solution analysis phase is intended to:
    - Expose analysis abilities.
4. The final part lets the candidate ask any questions he might have and is mostly for their benefit. This is important for two reasons:
    1. Good candidates have a choice of where to work, so they probably will have questions.
    2. The questions asked can be used to gauge the interest level of the candidate, which can help predict whether or not the candidate will accept an offer. (Occasionally, it can also show a marked lack of interest.)

Interviews may include additional parts:

- Easy question
- Design question
- Brainteaser
- Challenge

- An easy question is intended to efficiently expose candidates who obviously don't understand programming or who don't have a solid grasp on fundamental data structures.
- A design question checks whether candidates do requirements analysis, make prudent tradeoffs, come up creative, solutions and make decisions.
- A brainteaser or "impossible question" discerns a candidate ability to estimate. Since there is no right answer, the answer a candidate derives is less important than the methods used. Interviewers look for analysis skills and excitement to solve the problem, and reject candidates that become frustrated or require coaching.
- A challenge is where interviewers challenge a candidate's assertion despite knowing it to be true, to determine if a candidate will defend himself.

Specifically:

- Technical: Ask detailed question about the technology they used and how they used it. Ask specifically what role they played. Go into these question in great detail because this where you uncover the people either didn't know what they were doing or have made things up.
- Behavioral: Look for story of how the candidate handled challenges in the past-- people who got things done even in the face of opposition. Common bad signs include complaints without action or blaming others. Good signs include discussion of how candidates have fixed problems or gotten work done despite them even if candidate were unsuccessful.

Tips:

- Interviewers should observe the coding style of the candidate. Certain features may indicate the experience of a candidate with a specific language.
- Interviewers should be prepared to give hints if the candidate gets stuck to avoid wasting time on low-signal problems.

Beware of counter-signaling:

> When nerds are unbearable it's usually because they're trying too hard to seem smart. But the smarter they are, the less pressure they feel to act smart. So as a rule you can recognize genuinely smart people by their ability to say things like "I don't know," "Maybe you're right," and "I don't understand x well enough." - Paul Graham

#### Interview Validity

- The interviewers should reuse questions as a control.
- The interviewer should sitting next to (not across from) the candidate, to avoid a confrontational atmosphere which may compromise validity.
- The interviewer should reassure the candidate that they understand the difficulty of writing code on a whiteboard and will take it into account.
- The interviewer should avoid talking to anybody who may influence decision before making his decision to avoid Rosenthal effects (self-fulfilling prophecies) which may compromise validity.
- At least three people should interview the candidate, mostly would-be peers.

##### Interview Guides

When conducting a interview, the development of questions you ask should take into consideration:

- The focus of inquiry
- What you want to learn from the respondent
- How much time you have and the kind of access you have
- How much you already know about your question, and how to manage this knowledge

Interview guides should be developed iteratively - questions should be tested and then refined based on what one learns from responses.[11]

When conducting semi-structured or unstructured interviews, the interviewer develops a 'loose' guide, with general questions designed to open up conversation about the topic.  Often, this includes a series of follow-up questions or probes, prepared in advance, in order to elicit certain types of information from the informant.[11]

The interviewer must be a good listener, and that the best probing is that which is responsive, in the moment, to what the interviewee is saying.[11]

Researchers may be interested in creating or using a template to guide a researchers' observations. 

- Templates or observational coding sheets can be useful when data is collected by inexperienced observers
- Templates or observational coding sheets should only be developed after observation in the field that is not inhibited by such a template
- Theories and concepts can be driven by templates and result in focused data collectio
- Templates can deflect attention from unnamed categories, unimagined and unanticipated activities that can be very important to understanding a phenomenon and a setting 

## Results (Data Reporting)

### Field Notes

A researcher creates field notes when observing a social situation to remember and record the behaviors, activities, events and other features of the setting being observed. A researcher can read the notes later to produce meaning and an understanding of the culture, social situation or phenomenon being studied.

##### Jottings

Jottings, or scratch notes, are words or short sentences recorded by the observer in the field to aid the researcher's recall.

##### Preparing field notes

Generally, researchers write field notes shortly after observation to avoid forgetting important details.

Field notes should include:

- The date, time, and place of observation
- Description of what was observed
    - Specific facts, numbers, and details
    - Sensory impressions
    - Specific words, phrases, summaries of conversations, and insider language
    - Relevant context information
- Personal responses to the fact of recording fieldnotes
- Questions for future investigation

Field notes should be prepared so that the order of them can be rearranged and manipulated.

## Conclusions (Data Analysis)

At the end of a screen, interviewers must make a decision: "hire" or "no hire". While some decisions will be obvious, ambiguous decisions should default to "no-hire".

Analysis should consider:

- The kind of discussion emerges when questions are asked, identifying questions that might need to be refined.
- Identify new experiences shared by the interviewee that need to probed in subsequent interviews
- Identify who else one may want to interview -- remaining open to the possibility that interviewees may identify informants the researcher will want to interview
- Reflect on the interviewer's role, preconceptions and behavior during the interview in order to make any needed adjustments

Note, there are a number of things which are illegal to discuss in interviews, for instance, any suggestion of discrimination.

#### Analyzing Artifacts

When analyzing texts and artifacts, the researcher may focus on how and for whom the artifact is created, what is included and not included in the document, and how the document is used. 

Originally, content analysis developed as a quantitative method of analysis.  This method emerged in the areas of sociology and mass communication as a way to systematically and 'objectively' analyze media content.  This version of content analysis used standardized measurements to code, characterize and compare 'texts.' 

##### Analyzing Field notes

Analysis of field notes occurs both during preparation and during fieldwork. The latter is important for at least two reasons:

- This preliminary analysis fosters self-reflection, which is crucial for understanding and meaning-making. What was it like to be doing the research? What was comfortable? Uncomfortable? In what ways did you connect to informants?
- Preliminary analysis can reveal emergent themes which allow the researcher to shift his or her attention, focus questions, and potentially draw more developed conclusions.

# Culture Fit

## Candidate Choosiness & Turnover

> Beggars can't be choosers.

Candidate choosiness refers to the extent to which the candidate is careful in choosing a place to work.

### Background

The condition of the market is heavily in favor of high-quality employee. High-quality employees have the choice to be selective about where they work.

Regardless of the candidate's quality, candidates should be prepared to actively ask questions about their prospective workplace. High-quality candidates that have a choice of work will want to compare their offers, and low-quality candidates will want to signal interest.

Companies assess choosiness to gage the likeliness of a candidate accepting an offer. Candidates who are considered unlikely to accept an offer usually are rejected early.

Indicators of interest include:

- Tailored cover-letters
- Arriving on-time or early
- Appropriate dress
- Excitement
- Preparedness
    - Being able to answer "What do you know about our company?"
    - For instance, bringing a portfolio and notepad to interviews
- Did the candidate understand why he was interviewing?
- Ending interviews by asking for an offer

Though the presence of these indicators is a valid signal of interest, the lack of these indicators is not a valid signal of disinterest. For example, a candidate may have exhausted his questions after several interviews.

Candidates may assess culture by asking about:

- What is a typical day like?
- How do you like it here?
- What would you do differently if you could?
- How much interaction with the rest of the company is there?
- What sorts of projects will I be working on?
- What are future plans for the department? The company?

If all questions have been asked, candidates should briefly recap them and then decline time to ask them.

In general, there are two kinds of signals that being monitored: technical and behavioral. Technical signals give information about the candidate's intelligence while behavioral signals give information about the candidate's wisdom.

Most signals seem to correlate to virtues.

Good Technical:

- Accomplished. Completes assigned tasks.
- Intelligence. Ability to manipulate abstract concepts quickly.
- Excellence. Completes tasks beyond satisfactory completion.
- Ambitiousness. Constantly self-improves.
- Passion. Strong feelings and deep understanding of interests.
- Focus. Spends time in a disciplined manner.

Good Behavioral:

- Economy. Utilizes resources efficiently.
- Boldness. Performs uncomfortable actions when necessary. Takes risk and initiative.
- Tenacity. Perseveres through setbacks.
- Courage. Exhibits grace under pressure.
- Industry. Works hard.
- Self-reliance. Plans and prioritizes workload effectively.
- Loyalty. Puts the interest of the company first.
- Humility. Works well on a team. Give and takes orders and asks for help when appropriate.

> In one traditional pattern of development the merchants of the pre-industrial generation turn into the first entrepreneurs of the next. The best-documented case is Japan, but this also may have been the pattern for Britain and America. In our picture the important skill of the merchant is identifying the quality of merchandise; those who can identify used cars in our example and can guarantee the quality may profit by as much as the difference between type two trader' buying price and type one traders' selling price. These people are the merchants. In production these skills are equally necessary--both to be able to identify the quality of inputs and to certify the quality of outputs. And this is one (added) reason why the merchants may logically become the first entrepreneurs.
>
> The problem, of course, is that entrepreneurship may be a scarce resource; no development text leaves entrepreneurship unemphasized. Some treat it as central. Given, then, that entrepreneurship is scarce, there are two ways in which product variations impede development. First, the pay-off to trade is great for would be entrepreneurs, and hence they are diverted from production; second the amount entrepreneurial time per unit output is greater, the greater are the quality variations.

New grads are the hardest to value since they have no performance to measure yet.

> What's an especially productive 22 year old to do? One thing you can do is go over the heads of organizations, directly to the users. Any company that hires you is, economically, acting as a proxy for the customer. The rate at which they value you (though they may not consciously realize it) is an attempt to guess your value to the user. But there's a way to appeal their judgement. If you want, you can opt to be valued directly by users, by starting your own company.

> The market is a lot more discerning than any employer. And it is completely non-discriminatory. On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog. And more to the point, nobody knows you're 22.

> If you're really productive, why not make employers pay market rate for you? Why go work as an ordinary employee for a big company, when you could start a startup and make them buy it to get you? [11]
