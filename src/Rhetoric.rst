Rhetoric
================================================================================

Rhetoric is the art of discourse_.

Rhetoric studies the form of communication rather than the content.

Rhetoric is one of the core subjects in the trivium_.

Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic_. All men make use of both for
all men attempt to discuss statement and maintain them, to defend themselves
and attack others. Ordinary men do so ad-hoc, but it possible to study formally.

Rhetoric consists of five parts:

1. Invention
2. Arrangement
3. Style
4. Memory_
5. Delivery

Rhetoric shares with dialectic_ training in invention and arrangement, which has
sometimes reduced rhetoric to style alone.
