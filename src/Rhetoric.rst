Rhetoric
================================================================================

Rhetoric is the art of discourse.

Rhetoric studies the form of communication rather than the content.

Rhetoric is one of the core subjects in the trivium_.

Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic. All men make use of both for
all men attempt to discuss statement and maintain them, to defend themselves
and attack others. Ordinary men do so ad-hoc, but it possible to study formally.

Rhetoric shares with dialectic training in invention and arrangement, which has
sometimes reduced rhetoric to style alone.

Rhetoric consists of five parts:

1. Invention
2. Arrangement
3. Style
4. Memory
5. Delivery
