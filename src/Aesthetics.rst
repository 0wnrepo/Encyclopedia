Aesthetics
================================================================================

Aesthetics is the study of quality. It attempts to discover what makes things
beautiful.

---

Life without aesthetics is dreary. There is no way to distinguish between the
quality of items.

Clothes become a matter of retaining heat. Food becomes a matter of staying
alive and well. There can be no incentive to do anything since no value
judgments can be made. Even life and not life become indistinguishable.

It follows that aesthetics are not something to be put by the wayside, and more
so, that it is worthy of study. An understanding of aesthetics is an
understanding of what makes life good.
