Grammaticality judgment task
================================================================================

A **grammaticality judgment task** is a psychological experiment used to test
subconscious knowledge. A judgment involves asking a native speaker to read a
sentence_ and judge whether it is well-formed, marginally well-formed, or
ill-formed.

There are several different kinds of grammatically judgments. An ill-formed
sentences could be so for different reasons.

- A sentence could be semantically ill-formed if its form is okay, but it has no
  meaning (e.g. "The toothbrush is pregnant").

- A sentence could be syntactically ill-formed if we can deduce the meaning, but
  its form is bad (e.g. "Toothbrush the is blue").
