Communication
================================================================================

Communication is a `joint act`_ of transferring of information between a source
and a destination. [2]_

Daniel Sperber & Denise Wilson characterize it as:

    ... a process involving two information-processing devices. One device
    modifies the physical environment of the other. As a result, the second
    device constructs representations similar to the representations already
    stored in the first device.

For example:

* Fax machine transmissions
* Policeman directing traffic
* Conversation among intimates

Process
================================================================================

Communication requires two coordinated actions and cannot be performed alone: [2]

1. Sending
2. Receiving

Purpose
================================================================================

Users communication to:

- Express thoughts
- Represent aspects of the world

Kinds
================================================================================

- Human communication
- Nonhuman communication
