Generative grammar
================================================================================

**Generative grammar** is a popular theory of grammar_. Its central claim is
that sentences_ are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part
of our minds.

In generative grammar, the means for modeling these procedures is through a set
of formal grammatical rules, which tell us the order in which to put word. These
rules are through to generate the sentences of a language, hence the name
*generative* grammar. These rules tell you step by step how to put together
words into a sentence.

History & Influence
================================================================================

Generative grammar originate from the work of `Noam Chomsky`_ and his followers,
starting in the mid 1950s and continuing to this day.

Generative grammar has had many different names through its development
(`Transformational Grammar` (TG), `Transformational Generative Grammar`,
`Standard Theory`, `Extended Standard Theory`, `Government and Binding Theory`
(GB), `Principles and Parameters approach` (P&P), and Minimalism (MP)).

A number of alternate theories of syntax have also branched off of
this research program; these include `Lexical Functional Grammar` (LFG) and
`Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar` (HPSG).
