Code
================================================================================

A code is a system into which signs_ are organized.[3]

A code is a system of meaning common to the members of a culture or subculture.[2]

* spoken language
* Morse code
* Braille
* semaphore
* deaf-and-dumb sign language
* handwriting
* printing

A code enable users to encode and decode messages_.

Communication is most effective when users use exactly the same code.

Insofar as a code is isomorphic, meaning can be preserved. Insofar as it is not, meaning is lost due to noise.

A code consists of:[2]

1. A set of signs_
2. A set of conventions (or combination rules)

Encoding is the process of creating a message_ for transmission by an addresser
to an addressee.

Distinctions
================================================================================

We distinguish between:

1. Behavioral codes & Signifying codes[3]

The distinction between behavioral and signifying code is not always clear.

* The Highway Code is both behavioral and a signifying system

.. todo: is this just prescriptive / descriptive?

Behavioral code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A code of behavior is ...

* legal code
* manners
* rugby

Signifying code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A signifying code is a system of signs.[3]

No signifying code can be properly be divorced from the social practices of its users.[3]

Features:

1. Every code has a paradigmatic dimension and syntagmatic dimension.

2. Every code is conventional.

3. Every code is transmittable by appropriate media and/or channels of
   communication.

4. Every code conveys meaning.

5. Every code performs an identifiable social or communicative function.

Distinctions:

1. Analog & Digital

2. Presentational & Representational

3. Elaborated & Restricted

Analog & Digital
================================================================================

Two types of paradigms exist which give their names to types of code:

1. Analog
2. Digital

An analog code is a code that works on a continuous scale.

* an analog watch has a continuous scale and only by putting marks on the dial
  can we read it 'digitally'

* dance

A digital code is a code whose units (signifier and signified) are clearly
separated.

* a digital watch separates one minute from the next

Digital codes are easier to understand simply because their units are clearly
distinguished.

Arbitrary codes are digital.

Digital codes are easy to notate. Analog codes are difficult to notate.

* Music is potentially an analog code, though our system of notation has given
  it distinctive features (notes and scales) and thus imposed upon it a digital
  code

* Dance is analog and hard to record

Nature is generally composed of analogs; in trying to understand it we impose
digital differences upon it.

* the seven ages of man

* intimate, personal, semi-public, and public distances between people

* putting sixty marks around the perimeter of a clockface is a metaphor of how
  we impose meaning upon reality

The search for significant differences or distinctive features is crucial to the
textual side of meaning.

In arbitrary or symbolic codes, it is a straightforward process, for if the
units of a paradigm are stated and agreed, the differences between them must be
identified.

Codes composed of iconic signs pose problems.

The perception of reality itself is itself an encoding process.[3]

Perception involves making sense of the data before us: it involves identifying
significant differences and thus identifying units. It then involves the
perception of the relationship between these units, so that we can them as a
whole-- in other words, it involves created paradigms and syntagms. Our
perception and understand of reality is as specific to our culture as our
language is. It is in this sense we talk of reality as a social construct.[3]

### Presentational codes & Representational codes

#### Presentational codes

Presentational codes are indexical; they cannot stand for something apart from
themselves and their encoder.

Presentational codes indicate aspects of the communicator and of his or her
present social situation.

Non-verbal communication is carried on through presentational codes.

* gestures
* eye movements
* qualities of voice

Presentational codes can give messages only about the here and now.

* tone of voice can indicate present attitude to subject and listener; cannot
  send a message about feelings last week

Presentational codes are limited to face-to-face communication or communication when the communicator is present.

The human body is the main transmitter of presentational codes.

Ten codes classified by medium:[Argle 1972]

01. Bodily contact
02. Proximity
03. Orientation
04. Appearance
05. Head nods
06. Facial expression
07. Gestures
08. Posture
09. Eye movement and eye contact
10. Nonverbal aspects of speech

    - Prosodic codes
    - Paralinguistic code

(1) Bodily contact

Convey information about relationship via:

- Whom we touch
- Were we touch
- When we touch

This code and the next are ones that vary most between people of different cultures. 

Fact: The British touch each other less frequently than members of almost any other culture

(2) Proximity

- How closely we approach someone

Appears to be distinctive features that differentiate significantly different distances.

- Withing three feet is intimate
- Eight feet is personal
- Over eight feet is semi-public
- etc.

Actual distances may vary from culture to culture

    * the personal distance of Arabs can be as little as eighteen inches
    * Middle class distances tend to be slightly than the corresponding working class ones

(3) Orientation

- How we angle ourselves

    * Facing someone indicate either intimacy or aggression.
    * Being at 90 degrees indicates a cooperative stance

(4) Appearance

Divide into two:

- Aspects under voluntary control
    - hair, clothes, skin, paint, adornment
- Aspects less controllable
    - height, weight, etc

In all cultures, hair is highly significant as it is the most flexible part of our bodes; we can alter its appearance most easily.

Appearance is used to send message about personality, social status, and conformity.

(5) Head nods

Head nods are involved mainly in interaction management, particular in turn-taking in speech.

A nod gives the speaker permission to carry on.

Rapid nods may indicate a wish to speak.

(6) Facial expression

- Eyebrow position
- eye shape
- mouth shape
- nostril size

In various combinations these determine the expression of the face.

It is possible to write a grammar of their combinations and meanings.

Facial expression show less cross-cultural variant than most other presentational codes

(7) Gestures

- hand
- arm
- feet
- head

Closely coordinated with speech.

Supplement verbal communicate

Indicate either general emotional arousal or specific emotional states.

- beckoning

(8) Posture

- way of sitting, standing, and lying

Communicate a limited but interesting range of meanings.

Frequently concerned with interpersonal attitudes.

Indicates emotional states; degree of tension or relaxation.

Posture is less well controlled than facial expression; anxiety that does not show on the face may be given away by posture.

(9) Eye movement and eye contact

- when we meet
- how often we meet
- for how long we meet

sends message of dominance or affiliation

Staring someone out is a simple challenge of dominance
Makeing eyes at someone indicates a desire for affiliation
Makeing eye contact at the begining of a verbal statement indicates a desire to dominate the listener, to make him or her pay attention
Eye contact toward the end of or after a verbal statement indicates a more affiliative relationship, a desire for feedback, to see how the listener is reacting

(10) nonverbal aspects

(a) prosodic codes

- pitch and stress

    * "the shops are open on Sunday" can be made into a statement, a question, or an expression of surprise by the pitch of the voice

(b) paralinguistics codes

- tone
- volume
- accent
- speech errors
- speed

Indicate speaker's emotional state, personality, class, social status, way of viewing the listener, so on

#### Representational codes

Representational codes are used to produce texts (messages with an independent existence).

A text stands for something apart from itself and its encode.

A text is composed or iconic or symbolic signs.

#### Functions

Presentational codes have two functions:

1. Convey indexical information
2. Interaction management

(1) Information about the speaker and his our her situation through which the listener learns about his or her identity, emotions, attitudes, social positions, and so on.
(2) The codes are used to manage the sort of relationship wants with the other. By using certain gestures, posture, and tone of voice, I can attempt to dominate my fellows, be conciliatory towards them, or shut myself off from them. I can use codes to indicate that I have finished speaking and it is someone else's turn or to indicate desire to terminate the meeting. These codes are still, in a sense, indexical, but they are used to convey information about the relationship rather than about the speaker.

These two functions of presentational codes can also be performed by the representational insofar as presentational codes can be present in representational message.

    * a written text can have a 'tone of voice'
    * a photograph can convey depression or joy

Representational codes have a third function:

3. Convey information or ideas about things absent (cognitive or ideational)

(3) involves the creation of a message or a text that is independent of the communicator and situation.

Representational codes are the only ones that can perform the referential function.[3]

# Secondary codes

A message invented in the primary code of verbal language may be re-encoded into a variety of secondary codes:

# Correspondence

TODO: This is really rough.. and wrong.

A modality is a constrained set of of strings of strings and symbols.

Two modalities, X and Y, are equivalent if there exist a bijective function from X to Y, or if X and Y are isomorphic.

A modality, X, is more powerful than another modality, Y, if there is a epimorphism from X to Y, but not from Y to X.

SEE: Algebra

A modality hole is the presence of an element in one modality that has no corresponding element in another modality.

Many modalities are not isomorphic to others. This is evident in the phrase, "A picture is worth a thousand words" as well as more particular examples, like descriptions of gestalt perceptual groupings. 

# Closure

Closure is the phenomenon of observing the parts but perceiving the whole.

All of us perceive the world as a whole through the experience of our senses. Yet our senses can only reveal a world that is fragmented and incomplete. Our perception of "Reality" is an act of faith, based on mere fragments.

If visual iconography is the vocabulary of comics, closure is its grammar. In a sense, comics is closure. The closure of electronic media is continuous, largely involuntarily, and virtually imperceptible. But closure in comics is far from continuous and anything but involuntary.

## Classification

1. Moment-to-moment
2. Action-to-action
3. Subject-to-subject
4. Scene-to-scene
5. Aspect-to-aspect - Freezes time, and sets a wandering eye on different aspects of a place, idea or mood.
6. Non-sequitur

If we choose to see stories as connected series of events, then the predominance of 2-3-4 are easily explained. Types 2-4 shows things happening in concise effecient ways. Type 1 shows actions, but it tends to require several panels to do what type 2 does in two. Eastern comics tend to use more of 1 and 5. Japanese comics may be herirs to this tradition, in the way they so often emphasize being there over getting there.

Within any panel, we can only convey information visually, but between panels, none of our senses are require at all which is why all of our senses are engaged! Several times on every page the reader is released -- like a trapeze artist -- into the open air of imagination then caught by the outstretched arms of the ever present next panel! Caught quickly so as to not let the reader fall into confusion or boredom. But is it possible that closure can managed in some cases that the reader might learn to fly?

A good rule of thumb is that if readers are particularly aware of the art (either on account of medium or realism) then closure is probably not happening without some effort. Of course, making the reader work a little may be just what the artist is trying to do.

Formal languages are entirely syntactic in nature but may be given semantics that give meaning to the elements of the language.
