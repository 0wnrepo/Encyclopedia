Socratic dialogue
================================================================================

**Socratic dialogue** is a genre of prose developed in Greece, preserved today
in the dialogues of Plato_ and the Socratic works of Xenophon. Characters
discuss moral and philosophical problems, illustrating a version of the
`Socratic method`. The dialogues are either dramatic or narrative, and Socrates_
is often the main character.

Most of the Socratic dialogues today are those of Plato. Platonic dialogues
defined the literary genre subsequent philosophers used.

Plato wrote approximately 30 dialogues, in most of which Socrates is the main
character. No one know the exact order Plato's dialogues were written in, nor
the extent to which some might have been later and revised, and it is highly
disputed.

================================================================================

Socratic irony is "a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a
respondent, when actually he knows more".
