Clause
================================================================================

A **clause** is the smallest grammatical unit that can express a complete
proposition. A typical clause consists of a subject and a predicate, where the
predicate is typically a verb phrase.

Independent clauses are those that can stand alone as a sentence_. Dependent (or
subordinate) clauses are those that would be incomplete alone.
