Chomsky Hierarchy 
================================================================================

The Chomsky hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars
introduced by `Noam Chomsky`_ in 1956.

This is a containment hierarchy so the smaller boxes are contained in the larger
boxes.

Chomsky hierarchy from most powerful to least powerful:

0. Recursively enumerable languages

1. Context-sensitive languages

2. Context-free languages

3. Regular languages

Recursively Enumerable language
================================================================================

Recursively enumerable languages can be recognized by a Turing machine.

Context-Sensitive language
================================================================================

Context-sensitive languages can be recognized by a linear-bounded non-deterministic Turing Machine.

Context-free language (Phrase structure language)
================================================================================

A context-free language is a language generated by a context-free grammar. A context-free grammar is a formal grammar in which every production rule is of the form `V -> w` where `V` is a single nonterminal symbol, and `w` is a string of terminals or nonterminals.

Four components:

1. A set of terminal symbols, sometimes referred to as "tokens".
2. A set of nonterminals, sometimes called "syntactic variables".
3. A set of productions, where each production consists of a nonterminal, called the head or left side of the production, an arrow, and a sequence of terminals and/or nonterminals, called the body or right side of the production.
4. A designation of one of the nonterminals as the start symbol.

In computer science, a popular notation for context-free grammars is Backus-Naur Form.

CFGs can be recognized by non-deterministic pushdown automatons.

Regular Languages
================================================================================

CFGs can be recognized by a finite state automaton.
