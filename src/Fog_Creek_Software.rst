History
================================================================================

Finance
================================================================================

Originally FogCreek did consulting to make money.

As of December 2013: [1]_

- `FogBugz`_ is the main source of revenue, together with `Kiln`_.

- `Trello`_ is not making a ton of money (maybe 10% of revenue) but paid options
  were introduced only recently, and Trello is expected to be a large part of
  future revenue. FogCreek is hiring aggressively for Trello under this
  assumption.

- `Citydesk`_ and `Copilot`_ make nominal revenue

Technology
================================================================================

Only FogBugz, Kiln, and Trello remains under actively development. Copilot and
CityDesk are maintained and available for purchase. In addition, Fog Creek has a
dev tools division.

FogBugz
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FogBugz originally started as an internal bug tracking tool while the company
was focused on consulting.

FogBugz is written in a number of languages, including ASP and PHP, which are
compiled down to .NET. Some of it is written in an in-house language called
Wasabi which also compiles to .NET. Reportedly, Java can be found. [2]_

FogBugz is being rewritten in C# (termed "FastBugz").

Kiln
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kiln is written entirely in C#.

Trello
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trello was prototyped in `Creek Week`_ after Joel suggested the idea to some
designers.

Trello is written in Coffeescript, node.js, and MongoDB.

Copilot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Copilot (originally Project Aardvark) is written in C++ and was developed by a
group of interns.

- $5000/mo ($31/hr)
- Free housing
- Free gym membership

Culture
================================================================================

Fog Creek was built according to Joel's theory of building software companies,
which is basically: attract the best software developers and then outperform
competition (see: `Hitting the high notes`).

Engineering Culture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since software is the product being sold, the company is very engineering
focused and takes pride in shipping quality software. [1]_ [2]_ For instance,
the FogBugz team consciously tries to improve its development process, [2]_ and
the Trello team does not release code before review. [1]_

Structure is fairly flat, and nobody is far away from either founder. There is
at team for each service and each team is lead by a PM (who was at one point
formerly a developer). [1]_ Implementation and design is left entirely to
developers. [1]_

.. _creek week:

Developers have leeway on decisions somewhere in between a startup and midsize
(~250) company. [1]_ Engineers may work on their own projects with permission
(e.g. `WebPutty`_).  Additionally, Fog Creek regularly a "Creek Week" (hack
week) where developers are free to prototype new ideas. [2]_ There is
opportunity to switch teams. Two of senior engineers now on Trello were on
FogBugz. [2]_

Engineers are very smart, which means you can trust other people to complete
their work well, and they are very good about teaching. Programming interests
are diverse, which means there is a lot to be learned. [2]_

Company Culture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   A lot of the people here hang out together after work. [1]_

-   Intern events. Once every week or two weeks, devs and interns go do
    something cool in NYC. [1]_

-   Every Thursday people stick around and play board games. 10-15 people
    there. [1]_

-   Every Friday people sticks around for beer. [1]_

-   Many people do not know anyone in the city so they hang out often. Notably,
    improv classes were mentioned. [1]_

-   Half of people are 23 +/- 5 years. [1]_

Team preferences for new hires are usually accommodated. [2]_

Competition
