Letter recognition
================================================================================

**Letter recognition** (or letter perception) is the ability of a reader to
recognize written letters correctly.

Letter recognition is subject to the `word superiority effect`_.

Historical findings support the view that |LP|_ in |Ws| and |-Ws| is influenced
by |WC|_. [1]_ However, it is possible to interpret the same finding in terms of
`postperceptual guessing` [2]_ or `postperceptual forgetting processes` [3]_.
`Reicher 1969`_ eliminated these nonperceptual interpretations and conclusively
demonstrated that |WC|_ facilitates |LP|_. [4]_

    - |WP|_ is possible in conditions where accurate |LP|_ is not.

    - At a given exposure level, |WP|_ is more accurate for common |Ws| than
      uncommon |Ws|.

    - |LP|_ is more accurate in |~Ws| than |-~Ws|.

    Word perception might be better than nonword perception simply because
    |Ss| could guess imperfectly perceived words based on their knowledge of
    English.

.. [3]
    |WP| might be better than |-WP| simply because a large number of unrelated
    |Ls| might pose a memory_ load that would limit accuracy of identification,
    even if all the |Ls| were perceived accurately

.. [4]
    Postperceptual guessing was eliminated because in Reicher's two-alternative
    `forced-choice`_ task, |LP| was more accurate in words despite the fact that
    either response alternatives would have formed a word.

    Postperceptual forgetting can be eliminated because |LP| was more accurate
    in words than with single |Ls|.
