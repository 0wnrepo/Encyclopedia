Banter
================================================================================

**Banter** is playful conversation_, usually between friends, which may rely on
humor or in-jokes at the expense of those taking part.

The purpose of banter may at first appear to be an offensive affront to the
other person's face. However, people engaging in such a conversation are often
signaling that they are comfortable enough in each other's company to be able to
say such things without causing harm.

Banter is particularly difficult for those on the autism spectrum and those with
semantic pragmatic disorder.
