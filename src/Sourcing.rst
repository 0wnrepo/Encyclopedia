Sourcing
================================================================================

Sourcing is the process of identifying plausibly qualified candidates ("finding
talent"). 

Identified candidates are called "leads", and sourcing is sometimes called "lead
generation".

Motivation
================================================================================

Good sourcing is important for a number of reasons:

1. Software is scalable
2. Top talent is difficult to find
3. Top talent is extremely valuable

### Software is scalable

To explain what that means, I'm going to rely on Nicolas Nasim Taleb who introduced the concept to me in his book, [_The Black Swan_][3]:

> [The most important piece of career advice] came when I was twenty-two, one February afternoon, in the corridor of a building at 3400 Walnut Street in Philadelphia, where I lived. A second-year Wharton student told me to get a profession that is "scalable," that is, one in which you are not paid by the hour and thus subject to the limitations of the amount of your labor...
>
> Some professions, such as dentists, consultants, or massage professionals, cannot be scaled: there is a cap on the number of patients or clients you can see in a given period of time. If you are a prostitute, you work by the hour and are (generally) paid by the hour. Furthermore, your presence is (I assume) necessary for the service you provide. If you open a fancy restaurant, you will at best steadily fill up the room (unless you franchise it). In these professions, no matter how highly paid, your income is subject to gravity. Your revenue depends on your continuous efforts more than on the quality of your decisions. Moreover, this kind of work is largely predictable: it will vary, but not to the point of making the income of a single day more significant than that of the rest of your life...
>
> Other professions allow you to add zeroes to your output (and your income), if you do well, at little or no extra effort. Now being lazy, considering laziness as an asset, and eager to free up the maximum amount of time in my day to meditate and read, I immediately (but mistakenly) drew a conclusion. I separated the "idea" person, who sells an intellectual product in the form of a transaction or a piece of work, from the "labor" person, who sells you his work.
>
> If you are an idea person, you do not have to work hard, only think intensely. You do the same work whether you produce a hundred units or a thousand. In quant trading, the same amount of work is involved in buying a hundred shares as in buying a hundred thousand, or even a million. It is the same phone call, the same computation, the same legal document, the same expenditure of brain cells, the same effort in verifying that the transaction is right. Furthermore, you can work from your bathtub or from a bar in Rome. You can use leverage as a replacement for work!

Clearly, software development is scalable. When fixing an error, a developer at Facebook doesn't repeatedly fix it for every Facebook user; he fixes it once and pushes it to the server where it is copied automatically.

Given that software is scalable, the value of a developer at a particular company is roughly equal to the developer's ability to produce value multiplied by the company's number of users.

### Talent is difficult to find

Like most markets suffering an economic shortage, the software job market favors the sellers, in this case, programmers. Consequently, good programmers are rarely on the market except by choice. Sourcing then necessarily involves a certain amount of hunting abilities.

Furthermore, and unlike other industries, top talent always have the option to start their own company.

### Talent is extremely valuable

Since money is not a motivating factor to top talent, great programmers are drastically undervalued.

> Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money. This isn't quite true. It is true that all they really care about is doing interesting work. But if you make enough money, you get to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money. But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they care more about what they do there than how much they get paid for it. [4]

## Design

What is good sourcing?

- Time to fill
- Hiring Manager Satisfaction

## Introduction

Leads may be classified as either "active" or "passive" depending on whether or not the lead has signaled interest.

Reciprocally, sourcing strategies may be classified as either "active" or "passive" depending on whether or not the strategy directly or indirectly engages leads.

Examples of active sourcing strategies include:

- Searching, via search engines or candidate databases (e.g. LinkedIn)
- Headhunting / Networking
- Soliciting referrals
- Internships

Examples of passive sourcing include strategy:

- "Help Wanted" signs
- Taking out ads
- Emailing list-servs
- Posting to job boards
- Sponsoring events

## Methodology

Regardless of the sourcing method used, a company must be able to provide value to prospective hires. If a company can do this, then the difference is a matter of cost-effectiveness. (NOTE: How did male and female attraction mechanisms diverge? It kind of looks something like, a women signals interest, and all the men try to signal value.)

Theoretically speaking, the effectiveness of sourcing strategies is dependent on the conditions of the job market.

On one hand, if the supply of qualified candidates exceeds demand and if the quality of candidates is not particularly important, then we might expect passive sourcing alone to be sufficient. On the other hand, if the supply of qualified candidates is below demand or the quality of candidates is highly important, then we might expect active sourcing to be necessary.

## Startups & Acqui-hiring

> I asked managers at Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Cisco and Microsoft how they'd feel about two candidates, both 24, with equal ability, one who'd tried to start a startup that tanked, and another who'd spent the two years since college working as a developer at a big company. Every one responded that they'd prefer the guy who'd tried to start his own company. Zod Nazem, who's in charge of engineering at Yahoo, said:
>
>   I actually put more value on the guy with the failed startup. And you can quote me!
>
> So there you have it. Want to get hired by Yahoo? Start your own company.


## A Note on Internships

There is a popular misconception among those unfamiliar with that (all) companies hire interns for cheap labor. In the software industry, internships are considered long-term sourcing and selection strategies.

In particular, internships are an opportunity for employers to source, select, and hire qualified candidates before they enter the job market. Consequently, interns are typically given real work and offers if performance is satisfactory.

# Getting an interview

- Start thinking about summer internships around winter break[1]
- Get a referral rather than applying directly when possible[1]
- Consider a mass application or summer program[1]
- May want to write separate resumes for big companies and startups

## Big Companies [2]

- Looking to hire long term
- Want to hire engineer who will be great developers if they require training
- Have people dedicated to fill specific functions
    - Only responsibility of software developer is software
- Attempting to evaluate aptitude, not so much current skills

- Signals
    - School
    - High GPA (~3.7)
    - Able to solve difficult algorithm problems
    - Able to work on large projects
- Irrelevant details
    - Specific technologies

## Startups [2]

- Signals
    - Know relevant languages and technologies
    - Initiative
    - Autonomy
        - Able to work without detailed direction
    - Handle diverse responsibilities
    - Understand startup business and product
    - Focused more on ability to write code than solve algorithms
    - Culture fit
