Lexicon
=======

A lexicon is `language`_'s inventory of `lexemes`_, including bound `morphemes`_
which cannot stand alone as words (such as affixes).

A dictionary represents an attempt at listing in alphabetical order the lexicon
of a given language. In programming, this often corresponds to a standard
library.
