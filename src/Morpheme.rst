Morpheme
================================================================================

A morpheme is the smallest unit which carries meaning.

A morpheme is not identical to a word_, and the principal difference between the
two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone, whereas a word_, by
definition, is freestanding

Every word_ comprises one or more morphemes.

Example: 

Every morpheme is either free or bound. A free morpheme can function
independently as a word. A bound morpheme can appear only as part of words.

Either a morpheme is lexical or a morpheme is grammatical.

Classification
================================================================================

Morphemes may be divided into two classes: stems_ and affixes_.

.. _stems:

Stem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A stem is the core meaning-bearing unit.

.. _affixes:

Affix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An affix is a bound morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word.

An affix is unit that adheres to stems to change their meanings and grammatical
functions.

An affix may be lexical or inflectional.

Categories
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A affix is a prefix iff it appears before a stem.

Example: "un-do"

A affix is a suffix iff it appears after a stem.

Example: "do-ing"

A affix is an infix iff it appears within a stem.

Example: "Minne-flippin-sota"

A affix is a circumfix iff it appears around a stem.

Example: "en-light-en"
