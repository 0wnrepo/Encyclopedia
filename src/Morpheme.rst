Morpheme
================================================================================

A morpheme is the smallest unit which carries meaning.

A morpheme is not identical to a word_, and the principal difference between the
two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone, whereas a word_, by
definition, is freestanding

Every word_ comprises one or more morphemes.

Example: 

Every morpheme is either free or bound. A free morpheme can function
independently as a word. A bound morpheme can appear only as part of words.

Either a morpheme is lexical or a morpheme is grammatical.

Classification
================================================================================

Morphemes may be divided into two classes: stems_ and affixes_.
