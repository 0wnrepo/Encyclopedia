Eudaimonia
================================================================================

Eudaimonia (from "eu" *good* + "daimon" *course in life* or *life*) refers to
the truly good life.

Eudaimonia is often translated as "happiness" and "happy" which can be
misleading, since it neither is synonymous with "contentment" or "joy" nor
subjective. [1]_ Eudaimonia refers to an objective state of being; not how one
*feels* but how or what one is.

Though eudaimonia is pleasurable, one can live a pleasurable life that is not
good. (One may, for instance, derive pleasure from torture.)

Nothing guarantees eudaimonia since one never has complete control of one's
life, however, there are a number of necessary conditions without which, one is
guaranteed not to have it. These are the virtues: wisdom, justice, temperance,
courage, and piety. When one acts virtuously, one does what is good. Thus a
virtuous life is a life full of good acts; it is, in short, a good life. The
virtues are dispositions toward actions, or habits. They are not subjective
states-- merely feeling them does make one so.
