Syntagm
================================================================================

A syntagm is a message into which the chosen signs are combined.

- a road sign is a syntagm; a combination of the chosen shape with the chosen
  symbol

- a sentence_

Once a unit has been chosen from a paradigm it is normally combined with other
units. This combination is called a syntagm.

- a word is visual syntagm composed of a sequence of paradigmatic choices from
  the letters of the alphabet

- a sentence is visual syntagm of words

- clothes are a syntagm of choices from the paradigm of hats, ties, shirts,
  jackets, trousers, socks, etc.

- furnishing a room is a syntagm of choices from the paradigms of chairs,
  tables, settees, carpets, wallpapers

- a menu; the choices for each course are paradigms; the diner combines them
  into a meal; the order given to the waiter is a syntagm

All messages involve combination into a syntagm.

The important aspect is the rule or conventions by which the combinations of
units is made.

- in language, we call this grammar or syntax
- in music we call it melody
- clothes is good taste or fashion sense
- black bow-tie with black jacket and white collar means a dinner guest
- black bow-tie with black tailed coat and white wing collar means a waiter

In a syntagm the chosen sign can be affected by its relationship with others;
its meaning is determined partly by its relationship with others in the syntagm.
