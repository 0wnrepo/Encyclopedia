Grammatical Mood
================================================================================

Grammatical mood is a `grammatical category`_ that signals modality of verbs; it
the use of verbal inflections that allow speakers to express their attitude
toward what they are saying.

Mood is distinct from `grammatical tense` or `grammatical aspect`.

*   indicative
*   interrogatory
*   imperative
*   emphatic
*   subjunctive
*   injunctive
*   optative
*   potential

Realis Mood
================================================================================

A grammatical mood is realis iff it indicates that something is actually the
case or actually not the case.

The most common realis mood is the indicative mood.

Realis mood includes:

- indicative / declarative
- aggressive
- energetic
- evidential
- generic / gnomic
- mirative

Irrealis Mood
================================================================================

A grammatical mood is irrealis iff it is not a realis mood.

*   necessity
*   possibility
*   requirement
*   wish or desire
*   fear
*   counterfactual reasoning

Irrealis verb forms are used when speaking of an event which:

- has not happened
- is not likely to happen
- is otherwise far removed from the real course of events

* In "If you had done your homework, you wouldn't have failed the class", 'had
  done' is an irrealis verb form.

Some languages have distinct grammatical forms that indicate the event described
by a specific verb is an irrealis verb.

Irrealis moods include:

- Deontic (what should be)
    - commissive (promise, threats)
    - directive (command, requests, requirements)
    - deliberative
    - hortative
    - imperative
    - jussive
    - necessitative
    - permissive
    - precative
    - prohibitive
    - propositive
    - volitive (hopes, wishes, feats)
    - desiderative
    - propositive
- Epistemic (what may be)
    - alethic
    - assumptive
    - deductive
    - dubitative
    - hypothetical
    - inferential
    - interrogative
    - potential
    - speculative
    - subjunctive
- Dependent circumstances (what would be)
    - conditional
    - eventive

Indicative Mood
---------------

Also: Evidential Mood

The indicative mood is a realis mood used for factual statements and positive beliefs.

All intentions that a particular language does not categorize as another mood are classified as indicative.

*   "Paul eats an apple."

Subjunctive mood
----------------

The subjunctive mood, or conjunctive mood, has several uses in dependent clauses.

*   Discussing imaginary or hypothetical events and sitatuions
*   Expressing opinions or emotions
*   Making polite requests

A subjunctive mood exists in English, though it used in English much less than in many other Indo-European languages. In English, this mood has, for some uses, become something of a linguistic fossil.

*   "I suggest that Paul eat an Apple."
*   "I will ensure that he leave immediately" (archaic; overly formal)
*   "John would eat if he were hungry"

Conditional Mood
----------------

The conditional mood is used to speak of an event whose realization is dependent upon another conditions.

In Modern English, this type of modality is expressed with a periphrastic
construction with the form 'would' + `infinitive` (e.g. *I would buy*).

*   "John would eat if he were hungry"

Optative Mood
-------------

The optative mood is a grammatical mood that expresses a wish, hope, or command.

An optative expresses a wish of a speaker, but there no appeal to the addressee to make ie true.

Few languages have an optative as a distinct mood.

It is similar to the cohortative mood and is closely related to the subjunctive mood.

English has no morphological optative but there are various constructions with optative meaning.

  * Use the modal verb 'may'
    * "May you have a long life!"
  * Use the phrase 'if only' with a verb in the past or present subjunctive.
    * "If only I were rich!"
  * Use the present subjunctive.
    * "God save the Queen!"

Example of a language with an optative mood are:

  * Ancient Greek
  * Albanian
  * Armenian
  * Georgian
  * Kurdish
  * Navajo
  * Old Prussian
  * Sanskrit
  * Serbo-Croatian
  * Turkish

Imperative Mood
---------------

The imperative mood expresses direct commands, prohibitions, and requests.

In many cases, using the imperative mood may seem impolite, so it is often used
with care.

*   "Paul, do your homework now."

Many languages, including English, use the bare verb stem to form the imperative
(such as "go, "run", "do). Other languages, such as Seri and Latin, use special
imperative forms.

In English, the second person is implied by the imperative except when
first-person plural is specified, as in "Let's go."

In English, the imperative is sometimes used to form a conditional sentence.

*   "Go east for a mile, and you'll see it."

Prohibitive Mood
----------------

The prohibitive mood expresses a negative imperative.

*   "Do not go."

Jussive Mood
------------

The jussive mood expresses pleading, insistence, imploring, self-encouragement,
wishing desiring, intention, commanding, purpose, or consequence.

The jussive mood is found in Arabic.

Potential Mood
--------------

The potential mood is a mood probability indicating that, in the opinion of the
speaker, the action or occurrence is considered likely.

Used in:

- Persian
- Hungarian
- Finnish
- Japanese
- Sanskrit
- Sami

In English, the potential mood is formed by means of the auxiliary 'may', 'can',
'ought', and 'must'.

*   "She may go."

Interrogative Mood
------------------

Most languages do not have a special mood for asking questions, but exceptions
include Welsh and Nenets.
