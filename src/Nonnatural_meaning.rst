Non-natural meaning
================================================================================

Non-natural meaning (or a fallible-sign) describes a connection between an
agent's action and its intended consequences.

* In uttering "Please sit down" Paul meant that Jean was to sit down.
* "Those three rings on the bell (of the bus) mean that the 'bus is full'" (note, it could just as easily be four rings)
* "That remark, 'Smith couldn't get on without his trouble and strife,' mean that Smith found his wife indispensable."
* "The sentence 'Snow is white' means that snow is white." could just as easily have meant anything else.

Formally, a sign `x` is a nonnatural sign iff a speaker, `S`, intended by `x` to cause effect `E` in audience `A` by means of `A` recognizing this intention, [5] or equivalently, in doing `x`, a speaker `S` means that for audience `A` if and only if (i) `S` intends that `A` recognize that `p` in part by recognize that i."[1]

For a sign to be nonnatural, a speaker must have three intentions:[2]

1. `S` intends `A` to `E` by signaling `x`
2. `S` intends `A` to recognize 1
3. `S` intends `A` to `E` because `A` recognizes 1
    
Informally, we say something like:

- "`x` meant `E`"
- "`S` meant `E` by `x`"

Note: `x` is called a "locutionary act".

Note: `E` is called a "perlocutionary effect" or "perlocution".

Properties:

1. Non-natural signs do not entail what they stand for. (e.g.The director may (intentionally or unintentionally) ring the bell three times even if the bus is not full.)
2. One can infer something about what was meant by a nonnatural sign
3. One can mean something by a nonnatural sign
4. One can restate such sentences such that the verb "mean" is followed by a sentence or a phrase in inverted commas. (e.g. "Those three rings on the bell mean 'the bus is full'.")
5. One cannot restate such sentences so as to begin with "the fact that". (e.g. "The fact that the bell has been rung three times means that the bus is full")
