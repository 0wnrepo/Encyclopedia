Vagueness
================================================================================

Vagueness refers to ...

The connotation_ of a name_ is inherently vague; it is impossible to precisely
decide how much a particular word does or does not connote.

Example: "rich"

.. contents::

Criteria
================================================================================

A concept is vague if:

1. The concept's extension is unclear

2. If objects exist which one cannot say with certainty whether belong to a
   group of objects which are identified with this concept or which exhibit
   characteristics that have this predicate ("borderlines cases")

3. If `the Sorites paradox`_ applies to the concept or predicate

Properties
================================================================================

Vagueness is a problem even when a name can be extensively defined.

Example: A child might know who its brothers and sisters are before
understanding what "brother" and "sister" mean mean. (Mill, On Names)

The connotation of a name changes with its extension.

:Example:
    If every swan observed has been white, "swan" might connote white. If a
    black swan is then observed, "swan" no longer connotes white.

:Example:
    When Sophroniscus was alive, "alive" was a name of him.

:Example:
    "Awful" originally meant "inspiring awe", but today loosely means "bad".
    (semantic drift)

Analysis
================================================================================

There are problems that come about vagueness due to ostenative definitions. Some
things are clearly "white" or not so it's easy to learn, but other things are
less so clear. This is a problem because vague language causes vague thought and
vague communication. For children, ostenative definitions work because there is
an authority to point them out, but for adults there is no oracle (propio motu).
Thus we classify based on superficial similarity. The result is the name creep
onward until they lose all common meaning, sometimes even losing any common
attribute besides the name. This happens in science too when we reuse old words
to mean new things. The ideas are expressed more and more imperfectly.

Since fixing the overloading of words is a problem, the problem of the
philosopher is to keep language and alleviate its imperfections. This can only
be done by giving every general concrete name a definite and fixed connotation,
and doing so without rendering any existing common propositions untrue.

This process is the goal whenever anyone gives a definition of a general name
already in use.

The possibility of evil is pretty clearly seen in the moral sciences.

.. And in Games and new schools of thought. Shared vocabulary, etc etc.

The Sorites paradox
================================================================================

Consider a heap of sand from which grains are individually removed.

One might construct the following argument, using premises, as follows:

1. 1000000 grains of sand is a heap of sand

2. A heap of sand minus one grain is still a heap

Repeated applications of (2) forces one to accept the conclusion that a heap may be composed of just one grain of sand.

History
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The word "sorites" derives from the Greek word for heap.

The paradox is attributed to Eubuilides of Miletus.
