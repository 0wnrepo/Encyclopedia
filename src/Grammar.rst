Grammar
================================================================================

A grammar is the set of structural rules that governs the valid composition of
`words`, `phrases`, and `clauses` in a language_. A grammar consists of a
morphology_ and a syntax_.

Grammar is unlike school grammar which is a social norm. So "incorrect"
grammar still is grammatical; it's just different (e.g. British English and
American English).

.. note::

    The particular patterns of mental grammar may be different across languages, but patterns of comparable complexity can always be found.

The rules of grammar are unobservable and they must be studied indirectly.

.. note::

    That we can command language without being conscious of it is similar to the command of our bodies.
