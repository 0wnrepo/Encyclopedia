Grammar
================================================================================

**Grammar** is the study of structural rules that governs the valid
composition of words_, phrases_, and clauses_ in a language_. Grammar includes
morphology_, syntax_, and phonology_.

A grammar refers to a set of such rules which constitute a theory of a language.

Prescriptive grammar & Descriptive grammar
================================================================================

There are two ways to go about writing grammatical rules:

1. Prescriptive rules, which prescribe how people should speak

2. Descriptive rules, which describe how people actually speak

.. todo: is is redundant to say "prescribe how people should speak"?

Grammaticality
================================================================================

Sentences_ are either grammatical or ungrammatical.

Grammatical sentences may be prescriptively valid or invalid. If valid, they may
be uncontroversially so, formally so (e.g. "To whom am I speaking?", i.e.
something which must be taught), difficult to parse ("Cheese mice love stinks."
or "I saw the man with the telescope."), semantically anomalous ("Blue is
circular.").

Prescriptively invalid sentences may be either dialectical ("The car needs
washed") or informal ("Me and John went to the store.").

:Notation: A sentence that begins with ``*`` is ungrammatical. 

:Notation: A sentence that begins with ``%`` is a dialectical variant.

:Notation: A sentence that begins with ``#`` is semantically ill-formed.

Research
================================================================================

The rules of grammar are unobservable and they must be studied indirectly.

Kinds
================================================================================

1. Transformation Grammar

Transformation Grammar
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A transformational grammar is a `generative grammar`_ that has been developed in
the Chomskyan tradition of phase structure grammar.

Levels of adequacy
================================================================================

In `Aspects of the Theory of Syntax` (1965), `Noam Chomsky`_ introduced a
hierarchy of **levels of adequacy** for evaluating grammars. Chomsky claimed
that there are three stages a that a grammar can attain. From least adequate to
most adequate:

1. Observationally adequacy

2. Descriptive adequacy 

3. Explanatory adequacy

Observational adequacy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A theory is observationally adequate if it accounts for data in a corpus.

Such a grammar does not tell us what kind of sentences are unacceptable or
ill-formed.

Descriptive adequacy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A theory is said to be a *descriptively adequate grammar* if it accounts for
both corpora and native speaker intuitions about well-formedness.

Explanatory adequacy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A theory is said to be an *explanatorily adequate grammar* if it accounts for
corpora, native speaker intuitions, and how children acquire their language.
