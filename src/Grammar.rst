Grammar
================================================================================

A grammar is a set of structural rules that governs the valid composition of
words_, `phrases`, and `clauses` in a language_. A grammar consists of a
morphology_ and a syntax_.

Grammar is unlike school grammar which is a social norm. So "incorrect"
grammar still is grammatical; it's just different (e.g. British English and
American English).

Sentences are either grammatical or ungrammatical. Grammatical sentences may be
prescriptively OK or not. If so, they may be uncontroversially so, formally so
(e.g. "To whom am I speaking?", i.e. something which must be taught), difficult
to parse ("Cheese mice love stinks." or "I saw the man with the telescope."),
semantically anomalous ("Blue is circular."). Non-prescriptive may be either
dialectical ("The car needs washed.") or informal ("Me and John went to the
store.").

Notation: ``*`` means ungrammatical, ``%`` usually means dialectical variant.

The particular patterns of mental grammar may be different across languages,
but patterns of comparable complexity can always be found.

The rules of grammar are unobservable and they must be studied indirectly.

A transformational grammar is a generative grammar that has been developed in
the Chomskyan tradition of phase structure grammar.
