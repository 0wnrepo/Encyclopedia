Grammar refers to the study of structural rules that governs the valid
composition of words_, `phrases`, and `clauses` in a language_.

A grammar refers to a set of such rules.

Prescriptive grammar & Descriptive grammar
================================================================================

There are two ways to go about writing grammatical rules:

1. Prescriptive rules, which prescribe how people should speak

2. Descriptive rules, which describe how people actually speak

Grammaticality
================================================================================

Sentences are either grammatical or ungrammatical.

Grammatical sentences may be prescriptively valid or invalid. If valid, they may
be uncontroversially so, formally so (e.g. "To whom am I speaking?", i.e.
something which must be taught), difficult to parse ("Cheese mice love stinks."
or "I saw the man with the telescope."), semantically anomalous ("Blue is
circular.").

Prescriptively invalid sentences may be either dialectical ("The car needs
washed") or informal ("Me and John went to the store.").

:Notation: A sentence that begins with ``*`` is ungrammatical. 
:Notation: A sentence that begins with ``%`` is a dialectical variant.

Research
================================================================================

The rules of grammar are unobservable and they must be studied indirectly.

1. Transformation Grammar

Transformation Grammar
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A transformational grammar is a `generative grammar`_ that has been developed in
the Chomskyan tradition of phase structure grammar.
