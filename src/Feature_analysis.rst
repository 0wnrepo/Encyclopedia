Feature analysis
================================================================================

Feature analysis is a form of `pattern recognition`_ where each pattern is
represented in memory_ in terms of its component parts and their relationships.
[1]_

Given the limitations of `template matching`_, psychologists have turned to
`feature analysis`_ as an alternative description of `pattern recognition`_.

Matching individual features is the same as `template matching`_ a set of
mini-templates, so feature analysis is not a foulproof panacea for the
difficulties faced by `template matching`_.

The advantage gained by feature analysis is simply in terms of the smaller size
of the units being matched.

The feature analysis approach has been influenced by work in `artificial
intelligence`_, linguistics_, and `visual neurophysiology`.

Although we experience a pattern as integral whole, the work in AI, linguistic,
and neurophysiology encouraged psychologists to develop features models of
pattern recognition with the follow characteristics:

1. Patterns are described in terms of their component parts of features, as
   opposed to holistic templates.

2. These parts of features take on different values for different patterns --
   the features differentiate the patterns from one another. Thus the letter
   ``A`` has oblique lines whereas ``H`` has vertical ones.

3. The features can be arranged hierarchically, with the smallest features being
   grouped into somewhat larger features, and the somewhat larger features being
   grouped into even larger more complex features, and so on.

Models of feature analysis include the `Pandemonium architecture`_.
