Feature analysis
================================================================================

In feature analysis, each pattern is represented in memory_ in terms of its
component parts and their relationships.

Matching individual features is the same as matching a set of mini-templates, so
feature analysis is not a foulproof panacea for the difficulties faced by
template matching.

The advantage gained by feature analysis is simply in terms of the smaller size
of the units being matched.

The feature analysis approach has been influenced by work in `artificial
intelligence_`, linguistics_, and `visual neurophysiology`.
