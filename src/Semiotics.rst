Semiotics
================================================================================

Semiotics is the study of signs_ and sign processes.

Analysis
================================================================================

Semiotics consists of three parts:

1. Syntax_
2. Semantics_
3. Pragmatics_

Semiotics has three main areas of study:

1. Signs_ (varieties of signs, way they convey meaning, and way they relate)
2. Codes (systems into which signs are organized)
3. Culture within codes and sign operate

Semiotics focuses its attention primarily on the text_. (Note: Linear
process model do not.)

Semiotics calls the receiver_ the "reader" to imply a more active role.

Semiotics makes no distinction between encoder and decoder. Decoding is as
active and creative as encoding.

The study of code_ frequently emphasizes the social dimension of communication.

Our review of pragmatic and discourse has five parts:

    1. We consider traditional view of actions people perform in using language
    2. We consider a contrasting view about the way speakers and addresses act jointly in discourse
    3 and 4. Look at how participants in a discourse achieve local and more extended projects
    5. How they coordinate with each other in telling stories
