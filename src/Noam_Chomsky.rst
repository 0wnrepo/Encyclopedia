================================================================================

Avram Noam Chomsky was born December 7, 1928 in Philadelphia. Chomsky got his
Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied linguistics under
`Zellig Harris`.

In 1956, Chomsky published `Three Models for the Description of Language`, in
which he introduced transformation grammar.

In 1957, Chomsky published `Syntactic Structures`, in which he developed the
idea that sentences have two levels of representation: a deep structure and a
surface structure.
