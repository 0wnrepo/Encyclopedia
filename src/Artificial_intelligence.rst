    Artificial intelligence is is the intelligence exhibited by machines or
    software, and the branch of computer science that develops machines and
    software with intelligence. Major AI researchers and textbooks define the
    field as "the study and design of intelligent agents",[1] where an
    intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes
    actions that maximize its chances of success.[2] John McCarthy, who coined
    the term in 1955,[3] defines it as "the science and engineering of making
    intelligent machines".[4] - Wikipedia
