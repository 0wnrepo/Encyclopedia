================================================================================
Redundancy
================================================================================

Redundancy is that which is predictable in a message_.[2]

The opposite of redundancy is entropy.

Redundancy is the result of high predictability; entropy the result of low predictability.

Example: The English language is about 50% redundant. (We can delete about half of the words and still have a usable language.)

Redundancy performs two main functions:

1. Redundancy performs a technical function
    1.1. Provides a check that enables us to identify errors
    1.2. Improves accuracy of decoding
        1.2.1 Mitigates a noisy channel
        1.2.2 Mitigates a entropic message
        1.2.3 Mitigates a entropic receiver (audience)
2. Social

(1) Redundancy performs a technical function

(1.1) Redundancy provides a check that enables us to identify errors

Example: One can identify a spelling error because of redundancy.  In a non-redundant language, changing a letter would mean changing the word. (Of course, context might help, but insofar as it did, context would be a source of redundancy.)

Example: In natural language, words are not equiprobable. If I say "Spring is ..." then I am creating a context in which 'coming' is more probable and thus more redundant than say 'a pane of glass'.

We are always checking the accuracy of any message we receive against the probable which is probable is determined by our experience of the code, context, and type of message-- in other words, by our experience of convention and usage.

Convention is a major source of redundancy and thus of easy decoding.

Example: A writer who breaks with convention does want to be easily understood.

(1.2) Redundancy improves accuracy of decoding

(1.2.1) Redundancy mitigates a noisy channel

Example: We repeat ourselves on a bad telephone line
Example: When spelling words on radio, we say "A for apple", "S for sugar", etc.
Example: An advertiser who has to compete with competitors for attention (noise) will plan a simple repetitions predictable message
Example: An advertiser who can expect to have undivided attention (e.g. a technical advertiser in a specialist journal) can design a more entropic message which contains more information.

(1.2.2) Redundancy mitigates an entropic message.

-> A completely unexpected message will need saying more than once, often in different ways.

(1.2.3) Redundancy mitigates problems associated with the receiver (audience)

- To reach a large heterogeneous audience we need to design a message with a high degree of redundancy.
- To reach a small homogeneous audience, a entropic message is okay.

Example: Popular art is more redundant than highbrow art
Example: An advertisement for soap powder is more redundant than one for a business computer

(2) Redundancy performs a social function

(2.1) Phatic communication

A (polite) speaker may engage in phatic communication: acts of communication that contain no information ut that use existing channels simply to keep them open and usable.[Jakobson]

Example: Saying 'Hello' in the street (strengthens (or at least maintains) an existing relationship)

Phatic communication highly redundant.

A polite speaker, who indulges in phatic communication, is receiver-centered (or audience-centered) in the same way as a communicator who builds redundancy into his or her work.

## Redundancy & Convention

Structuring a message according to shared patterns or conventions is one way of decreasing entropy and increasing redundancy.

Example: aesthetic patterns
Example: rhythmic poetry (e.g. the end of a line must have one syllable and rhyme with last)
Example: syntax (e.g. restrict to a noun)

Redundancy is a critical party of aesthetic pleasure.

The more popular and widely accessible a work of art is, the more it will contain redundancies in form and content.

A highly conventional art form is a phatic function.

Example: The refrain of a folk song

By participating in convention, we reaffirm our membership of that particular group or subculture.

Subcultures are defined by their shared taste in art. Individual variations are permissible only within the limits of the conventions; entropic original elements are acceptable only within the redundancy of form.

Example: a stop light only needs one color, e.g. red, where 'on' means stop and 'off' means go, but in practice they add redundancy in order to prevent possible error in case light breaks down
