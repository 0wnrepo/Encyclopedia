Signaling Theory
================================================================================

Signaling theory deals with predicting the level of effort that individuals, the
signalers, should invest to communicate their properties to other individuals,
the receivers, and how these receivers interpret the signals.

Many of the things - such as toughness, cooperativeness or fertility â€“ that
people and animals want to know about each other are not directly observable.
Instead, observable indicators of these unobservable properties must be used to
communicate them to others. These are signals.

Two conditions have to be fulfilled before signaling theory should be applied:

1. There has to be informational asymmetry between the signaler and receiver.
2. The potential for divergence or conflict of interest between the signaler and receiver. 

Without either of these two conditions, there is no need for signals as the
problem is merely one of communication. Once these conditions are fulfilled,
signals have to be used by individuals to prove to the other person their
underlying hidden property.

Counter-signaling
================================================================================

In certain cases, noisy strong signals sent on behalf of candidates can
encourage agents not to signal actively in order to distinguish them from agents
who are less likely to get a positive signal sent on their behalf. Not signaling
is a sign of confidence and signaling is a sign of insecurity.[10]

Similar to the idea of letting one's reputation speak for itself. Your
reputation precedes you.
