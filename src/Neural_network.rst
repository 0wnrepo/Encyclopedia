    Neural networks are simplified models of the brain composed of large numbers
    of units (the analogs of neurons) together with weights that measure the
    strength of connections between the units. These weights model the effects
    of the synapses that link one neuron to another. Experiments on models of
    this kind have demonstrated an ability to learn such skills as face
    recognition, reading, and the detection of simple grammatical structure. -

    Neural networks are `computational models`_ inspired by animal central
    nervous systems (in particular the brain) that are capable of `machine
    learning` and `pattern recognition`_.

Because artificial neural networks provide some novel alternative solutions and
may also offer better descriptions of what the brain is actually doing than more
traditional models, such models are important candidates for experimental tests.
[1]_

In these models, scientists write computer programs to simulate the functioning
of neurons and their interactions. These programs provide a general and abstract
description of how real neurons might work, and at this stage of research, the
models they generate are far removed from the complexity of the human brain.
[1]_

In these simulation models, information_ is assumed to exist in the form of
activations and inhibitions of neuron-like *units*. All knowledge in the
simulated neural system is contained in the connections among the units and the
operations that map the input to the output. The units interact with one another
via connections among the units and therefore such models are often referred to
as "connectionist_ models". The connectivity is implemented by positive and
negative *weights* among the units. The units in connectionist_ models are
generally organized into several sets of "layers" such as an input and an output
layer. This connectionist_ framework has been used to model a broad variety of
psychological phenomena. [1]_

Basis
================================================================================

The human brain contains billions of individual nerve cells called "neurons".
Each neuron send excitatory or inhibitory messages to other neurons, and the
activity level of a neuron is determined by the approximately 1,000 excitatory
and inhibitory signals it receives from other neurons. [1]_
