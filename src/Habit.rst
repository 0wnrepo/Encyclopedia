Habit
================================================================================

A habit is an acquired mode of behavior_ that has become nearly or completely
involuntary.

Habits are formed from routines.

When doing is easier than thinking, habits form.

By removing the cost of thinking and choosing, we increase our ability to take
action.

Setting goals is not productive for forming habits.

Example: "Lose X pounds in N days."

Goals are difficult to keep up with, and people often break their commitments.

Instead, focus on engineering easy paths to a habit.

Tracking (feedback) can help as a master trigger.
