Lexeme
================================================================================


A lexeme, or word form, is an abstract unit of morphological analysis in
linguistics, that roughly corresponds to a set of forms taken by a single word.

Example: In the English language, "run", "runs", "ran" and "running" are forms
of the same lexeme, conventionally written as RUN.

Lexemes are grouped into `lemmas`_, which are generated by inflectional
morphology.

A lexeme consists of multiple `morphemes`.

A lexeme is phonological form of `lemma`_.
