Face-to-face conversation
================================================================================

Face-to-face conversation is the basic setting_ for `language use`_.

- Conversation is universal.

- Conversation requires no special training.

- Conversation is essential in acquiring one's first language.

Other settings lack the immediacy, medium, or control of face-to-face
conversation, so they require special techniques or practices. If we are ever to
characterize language use in all its settings, the one setting that should take
priority is face-to-face conversation.[4]

For a language setting to be basic, it should be universal to human
societies.[1] That eliminates written setting, since entire societies rely on
the spoken word.[4] One estimate is that about a sixth of the world's people are
illiterate.[4] We can also eliminate spoken settings that depend on technology
since these are hardly universal.[4] Most people participate only rarely in
nonpersonal, institutional, and prescriptive settings, and even then their
participation is usually restricted to certain roles.[4] The most common setting
is face-to-face conversation.[4]

Face-to-face conversation is the principal setting that doesn't require special
skills.[4] Reading and writing takes years of schooling and many people never do
get very good at them.

Face-to-face conversation is also the basic setting for children's acquisition
of their first language.[4]

Features of face-to-face conversation:

1. Immediacy
    01. Copresence - The participants share the same physical environment
    02. Visibility - The participants can see each other
    03. Audibility - The participants can hear each other
    04. Instantaneity - The participants perceive each other's actions at no perceptible delay
2. Medium
    05. Evanescence - The medium is evanescent - it fades quickly.
    06. Recordlessness - The participants actions leave no record or artifact.
    07. Simulateneity - The participants can produce and receive 
3. Control
    08. Extemporaneity -  The participants formulate and execute their actions extemporaneously, in real time.
    09. Self-determination - The participatnes determines for themselves
    10. Self-expression - Participants act as themselves

If face-to-face setting are basic, people should have to apply special skills or procedures whenever any of these features are missing.[4] The more features that are missing, the more specialized the skills and procedures.

Features 1-4 reflect the immediacy of face-to-face conversation.[4]

    * Telephones take away copresence and visibility, limiting and altering language use in certain ways.
    * Video conversations lack copresence, making them different too.
    * In nonpersonal settings, speaker have restricted access to addressees and vice versa changing how both parties proceed
    * Written settings lack all four features

Features 5-7 reflect the medium.[4]

    * Speech, gestures, and eye gaze are evanescent
    * Writing is not evanescent
    * Speech isn't ordinary recorded, but when it is, as on a telephone answering machine, participants proceed very differently
    * With written records and no instantaneity, writers can revise what they write before sending it off, and reader can reread, review and cite what they have read
    * Being able to speak and listen simultaneously given people in conversation such useful strategies as interrupting, overlapping their speech, and responding "uh huh", and these are ruled out in most written settings

Features 8-10 have to do with control--who controls what gets done and how.[4]

    * In face-to-face conversation, the participants are in full control; they speak for themselves, jointly determine who says what wen, and formulate their utterances as they go.
    * The church, determines the word of many prayers and response
    * In fictional settings, speakers and writers only make as if they taking certain actions

Private settings are sometimes considered the basic setting for language use. However, when we do talk to ourselves, the principal medium is the language we have acquired from others.[4]

Turns
================================================================================

In carrying out local projects, people coordinate on who speaks when.[1]

The reason seems clear; for a speaker to ask a question he must get her to attend to his voice, identify his phrasing, and understand what he means precisely as he is uttering what he says. He will not succeed if she is attending to something else-- if for example she is speaking to him[1]

Turns emerge from coordinating on contributions and joint projects.[1]

Presentation and Acceptance
---------------------------

In face-to-face conversation, contributions ordinarily consist of two phases:[2]

1. Presentation phase: A present B with utterance u
2. Acceptance phase: B provides A with evidence that B has understood what A meant by u well

The criterion A and B try to reach is this: the mutual belief that B has understood A well enough for current purposes. This is called the grounding criterion, and the process by which A and B reach it is called grounding.[2]

Most of the time the acceptance phase takes two forms:[2]

1. Acknowledging: Using back-channel responses, signals like "uh-hu" "yeah" head nods, and smiles.[2] (continuers)
2. Proceeding: The current addressee initiates an appropriate next turn.[2] This can just be answering a question. 

Others forms exist.[2]

- Side sequence
- Insertion sequence

Relation to Language use
================================================================================

Conversation is the fundamental site of `language use`_.

For many people, conversation is the only site.

Other arenas of language use are derivative.

Example:

- Novels
- Newspapers
- Lectures
- Street signs
- Rituals
