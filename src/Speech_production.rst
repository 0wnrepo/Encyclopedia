Speech Production
================================================================================

**Speech production** is spoken `language production`_.

Speech production has three parts:

1. `Conceptualization`_ (Semantic)
2. Grammatical Encoding (Grammatical)
3. `Articulation`_ (Phonological)

Separability of the semantic, grammatical, and phonological properties of words
================================================================================

One phenomenon is the tip-of-the-tongue state (TOT) in which a word eludes
retrieval. TOT offers some evidence that there is some separation of what a word
means and how it sounds because speakers can be fully aware of the meaning
without being able to come up with a word.

Anomic patients show the same dissociation between retrieval of grammatical
information and sound information.

Another influential approach to word production about the separation of meaning
and sound, emphasizes the speed with which the meaning and sounds of words are
recovered during the nameing of pictured objects.

A strong interpretation of the data is that the retrieval of semantic and
grammatical information strictly precedes the retrieval of phonological
information, but there is controversy that as candidate words for expressing
messages are located, it seems that their corresponding word form become active
even before the speaker settles on which candidate to select.

Though semantic effects tend to be obtained early and phonological effects late
during object naming, the impact of phonological information can be observed
before the semantically driven processes that settle on what word to use have
run their course.

The concurrent activity of meaning and sound during word production can also be
called on to explain errors that combine both semantic and phonological features
of intended words and the tendency for sound errors to create real words at
rates above chance.

The concurrency activity of meaning and sound constitutes a challenge to
theories that posit discrete stages in word production.

* To bridge the divide between meaning and sound in production, many theories
  postulate an intermediate retrieval step in the transition from a concept to
  the sound form that conventionally conveys the relevant meaning.
