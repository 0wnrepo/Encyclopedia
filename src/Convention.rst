The rule of a code_ determine:

- How signs_ are used
- How signs can be combined to form more complex messages
- In what contexts signs are used

All members of a community using a code must consent to the rules of a code.

Any aspect of our social life which is coded iff it is conventional (governed by
rules consented to by members of the society).

# Coordination and Convention (Lewis) 

A (social) convention is a regularity widely observed by some group of agents.

Example: Driving on the right side of the road in the United States.

Not every regularity is a convention.

Example: People eat, sleep, and breathe, yet none are conventions

Two putative conventions are money and language.

Example: "Money has become by convention a sort of representative of demand; and this is why it has the name “money” (“nomisma”)—because it exists not by nature but by law (nomos) and it is in our power to change it and make it useless" - Aristotle
Example: "A name is a spoken sound significant by convention… I say “by convention” because no name is a name naturally but only when it has become a symbol." - Aristotle

How does convention succeed in creating facts? (e.g. Confeerring value upon money or meaning upon linguistic terms)

> What are social conventions? A natural first thought is that they are explicit agreements, such as promises or contracts, enacted either by parties to the convention or by people suitably related to those parties (such as their ancestors). This conception underwrites at least one famous conventionalist account: Thomas Hobbes's theory of government as resulting from a social contract, into which agents enter so as to leave the state of nature. However, it seems clear that the vast majority of interesting social phenomena, including government, involve no explicit historical act of agreement. Social conventions can arise and persist without overt convening.

> Partly in response to such worries, John Locke emphasized the notion of a tacit agreement. A tacit agreement obtains if there has been no explicit agreement but matters are otherwise as if an explicit agreement occurred. A principal challenge here is explaining the precise respects in which matters are just as if an explicit agreement occurred.

Conventionalism is the doctrine that certain phenomenon are determined by convention.

Conventionalism surfaces in virtually every area of philosophy.

Example: Property in Hume's 'Treatise of Human Nature'

Every conventionalist theory shares the thesis that there exists alternative conventions that are in some sense equally good.

The choice of a convention is undetermined by the nature of things, by general rational considerations, or by universal features of human physiology, perception, or cognition.

---

Lewis center his account of convention around the notion of a (game-theoretical) coordination problem: a situation in which there are several ways agents may coordinate their actions for mutual benefit.

Coordination problems pervade social interaction.

Example: Drivers must coordinate to avoid collisions.
Example: Economic agents eliminate the need for bater by coordinating upon a common currency.

In many such cases, there is no way to communicate in advance, and there is no centralized authority to impose order.

> Lewis analyzes convention as an arbitrary, self-perpetuating solution to a recurring coordination problem. It is self-perpetuating because no one has reason to deviate from it, given that others conform.

Example: If everyone else drives on the right, I have reason to as well, since otherwise I will cause a collision.

> By classifying R as a convention only if there is some alternative regularity R′ that could serve as a convention, Lewis codifies the intuitive idea that conventions are arbitrary. This was one of the most widely heralded features of Lewis's definition, emphasized by both Quine (1969) and Putnam (1981).

> Notably, Lewis introduces the concept of common knowledge. Roughly, p is common knowledge iff everyone knows p, everyone knows that everyone knows p, everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows that p, etc.

>  Barring a few possible exceptions such as onomatopoeia, the association between a word and its referent is not grounded in the intrinsic nature of either the word or the referent. Rather, the association is arbitrary. In this weak sense, everyone agrees that language is conventional. However, disagreement persists about whether social convention plays a useful role in illuminating the workings of language.

David Lewis (1969) provides the first systematic theory of how social convention generates linguistic meaning.

> Lewis begins by studying signaling problems. A communicator has privileged information differentiating among states s1, …, sm. Audience members can choose among responses F(s1) …, F(sm). Everyone prefers that audience members do F(si) if si obtains. There is a set of signals x1, …, xn, m ≤ n, that the communicator can pass to the audience. In Lewis's example, the sexton knows whether the redcoats are staying home, coming by land, or coming by sea. By placing either zero, one, or two lanterns in the belfry, he signals Paul Revere whether to go home, warn people that redcoats are coming by land, or warn people that the redcoats are coming by sea. A signaling problem is a coordination problem, because communicator and audience must coordinate so that the communicator's signal elicits the mutually desired action.

In comparison with normal linguistic interaction, signaling problems are specialized.

A fundamental difference is that people normally need not agree upon which action(s) would be desirable, given some state of affairs.

> Although Lewis explored various ways around this difficulty, he eventually concluded that we should alter the analysis of convention. In “Languages and Language” (1975/1983), he broadened the analysis so that regularities of action and belief could serve as conventions. Clause (4) of Lewis's definition entails that everyone prefers to conform to the convention given that everyone else does. Preferences regarding one's own beliefs are dubiously relevant to ordinary conversation.

> The expectation of conformity to the convention gives everyone a good reason why he himself should conform (p. 167).

> The “reason” in question might be either a practical reason, in the case of action, or an epistemic reason, in the case of belief.

- Philosophers question platitudes that others accept without thinking twice; a dangerous profession, since philosophers are more easily discredited than platitudes, but a useful one.
- The philosophers does adherents a service; he makes them think twice.
- It is a platitude that language is ruled by convention.
    - Words might be used to mean almost anything.
    - We have made them mean what they do.
    - We have come to an understanding that we use them to mean things.
    - We might use otherwise -> foreign language
    - We might change our conventions -> Speak other language
- Quine and White argue that the supposed conventions of language cannot be much like the central, well-understood cases of convention.
- Conventions are agreements. How did we agree with one another to abide by the rules of use of language?
- The conventions of language could not possibly have originated by agreement, since some of them would have been needed to provide the rudimentary language in which he first agreement was made.
- We cannot even say what conventions are, except by long trial and error.
- We have no concept which permits language to be conventional; we are inclined to call some features of language conventional, but we cannot say why.
- Conclusion: The conventions of language are a myth. Language conforms to regularities and that is all.
- We may protest that there must be something to our notion of conventions of language even if we cannot say what.
    - We seem to intuitively understand the idea.

Conventionality must at least be that which evokes a distinctive response in anyone who been through our kind of education.

## Analysis of Coordination Problems

A coordination problem is a situation of interdependent decision by two or more agents in which coincidence of interest predominates and in which these are two or more proper coordination equilibria. 

Games of pure coordination: The agent's interests coincide perfectly.
Games of pure conflict:     The agent's interests oppose perfectly.

Other games are mixture of conflict and coordination.

We confine attention to situations in which coincide of interest predominates.

An equilibrium is a combination in which no one would have been better off had he alone acted otherwise.

A coordination equilibrium is an equilibrium as a combination in which no one would have been better of had any one agent alone acted otherwise, either himself or someone else.

An equilibrium in a pure coordination games is a coordination equilibrium.

Coordination equilibria are not confined to games of pure coordination. They can occur even in games of pure conflict.

In any finite two-person game of pure coordination with a unique equilibrium, at least one action of the agents is dominated.

## Solving Coordination Problems

Agents confronted by a coordination problem may or may not succeed in each acting to reach one of the possible coordination equilibria.

They may succeed by luck, but they are more likely to succeed through the agency of a system of suitably concordant mutual expectations.

Example: I may go to a certain place because I expect you to go there, while you go there because you expect me to.
Example: I may call back because I expect you not to, while you do not because you expect me to.

An agent would have a decisive reason to do his own part if he were sufficiently confident in his expectation that the others would do their parts of a certain proper coordination equilibrium

But, if his confidence is less than complete, he must balance his preference for doing his part if the other do theirs against his preference for acting otherwise if they do not.

The degree of confidence which is sufficient depends on all his payoffs and sometimes on the comparative probably he assigns to the different ways the others might not all do their parts, in case not all of them do.

We may achieve coordination by acting on our concordant expectations about each other's actions. We may acquire expectations, or correct or corroborate whatever expectations we already have, by putting ourselves in the other fellow's shoes, to the best of our ability.

Higher-order expectations allow us to reason about player's trying to predict each other's behavior.

With multiple agents, higher-order expectations become intractable.

Replication is process in which one person works out the consequences of his belief about the world (not an interaction back and forth between people) which is a world that he believes to include other people who are working out the consequences of their belief.

We rarely do have expectations of higher order than a third.

Any situation which justifies a high-order expectation would also justify low-order expectations directly, without recourse to nested replications.

Coordination might be rationally achieved with the aid of concordant mutual expectations about action.

Coordination may be rationally achieved with the aid of a system of concordant mutual expecations, of first or higher orders, about the agent's actions, preferences, and rationality.

The more orders of expectation about action contribute to an agent's decision, the more independent justifications the agent will have; and insofar as he is aware of those justifications, the more firmly his choice will be determined.

Circumstances that help to solve a coordination problem, therefore, are circumstances in which the agents become justified in forming mutual expectations belonging to a concordant system. And the more orders the better.

Now we consider agreement.

If the agents can communicate (without excessive cost), they can ensure a common understanding of their problem by discussing it. They can choose an arbitrary coordination equilibrium.

Coordination by means of agreement is not an alternative to coordination by means of concordant mutual expectations. Rather, agreement is one means of producing those expectations.

The agreement of agents might be an exchange of formal or tacit promises, but it need not be.

If one does consider himself bound by a promise, he has a second independent incentive. His payoff are modified, since he has attached onus of break to all but one choice. Indeed, he may modify his payoff so much by promising that the situation is no longer a coordination game at all. 

Forceful promising is a way of getting rid of a coordination problem, not a way of solving it.

Explicit agreement is a good and common means to coordination - so much so that we are tempted to speak of coordination otherwise produced as tacit agreement.

Agreement is not the only source of concordant expectations to help us solve our coordination problems.

We do without agreement by choice if we find ourselves already satisfied with the content and strength of our mutual expectations.

It turns out sophisticated subjects in an experimental setting often do better than chance at solving novel coordination problems without communicating.

They try for a coordination equilibrium that is somehow salient: one that stands out from the rest by its uniqueness in some conspicuous respect. It does not have to be uniquely good; it could be uniquely bad.

How can we explain coordination by salience?

- Perhaps salience is a last resort, used when there is no ground for a choice.
- Perhaps subjects expect each other to have a tendency to choose salient things.
- Perhaps a mixture.

Even in a novel coordination problem, agents can sometimes obtain the concordant expectations they need without communicating.

An easier and more common case is that of a familiar coordination problem without communication. Here the source of mutual of expectation is precedent: acquaintance with past solved intances of their present coordination problem.

### Convention

Suppose have been given a coordination problem and have reached some fairly good equilibrium. Given exactly the same problem again, perhaps each of us will repeat what he did before and reach the same solution.

We can explain the force of precedent just as we explained the force of salience.

Precedent is the source of one important kind of salience: conspicuous uniqueness of an equilibrium because we reached it last time.

We may tend to repeat the action that succeeded before if we have no strong reason to do otherwise.

We also consider that we are never given exactly the same problem. (At least, in the second game we can draw on our experience with the first.)

In a new game, we cannot do exactly what we did before because the situation is not exactly alike.

Consider a new problem analogous to the first. Guided by whatever analogy we notice, we tend to follow precedent by trying for a coordination equilibrium in the new problem which uniquely correspond to the one we reached before.

It's possible there are alternative analogies. If so, there is room for ambiguity.

There are always innumerable alternative analogies.

Were it not that we happen uniformly to notice some analogies and ignore others precdents would always be ambiguous and worthless.

Every coordination equilibrium in our new problem corresponds to uniquely to what we did before under some analogy.

Most of the analogies are artificial.

We learn that all of us will mostly notice the same analogies. Hence, precedent:s can be unambiguous in practice and often are.

We not in trouble unless conflict analogies force themselves on our attention.

The more respects of similarity between the new problem and the precedent, the more likely it is that different analogies will turn out to agree, the less room there will be for ambiguity, and the easier it will be to follow precedent.

Salience in general is uniqueness of a coordination equilibrium in a preeminently conspicuous respect.

The salience due to precedent is no exception. It is uniqueness of a coordination equilibrium in virtue of its preeminently conspicuous analogy to what was done successfully before.

So far we have supposed that the agent who set the precedent are the ones who follow it.

So far we have supposed that we have a single precdent to follow. We may have several.

In such a case, the agent's actions conformed to some noticeable regularity.

Each of wants to conform to it if the others do; he has a conditional preference for conformity.

It does not matter why coordination was achieved at analogous equilibrium in the previous cases.

Even if it happened by luck, we could still follow the precedent set.

Several precedents are better than ony because we learn from reptition and because differences between precedents help to resolve ambiguity. Even if our situation bears conflicting analogies to any one precdent, maybe only one of these analogies will hold between the precedent so we will pay attention to that one.

Once there are many precedents available, without substantial disagreement or ambiguity, it is no longer necessary for all of us to be acquainted with precisely the same ones.

It is enough if each of us is acquainted with some agreeing precedents.

Easy to see how the ight happen: If one has often encountered cases in which coordination was achieved in a certain problem by conforming to regularity and rarely encountered cases in which it was not, one is entitled to expect neigbhors to ahve same experience.

Example: If I have driven around the US and seen many people driving on the right and never one on the left, I may reasonably infer that almost everone in the US drives on the right, and hence that this man driving toward me also mostly seen people driving on the right - even if he and I have not seen any of the same people driving on the right.

ME: That is  argument for induction there.

Our acquaintance with a precedent need not be detailed. It is enough to know that of many cases in which and how coordination was achieved by conforming to a certain regularity. There is no need to specify the time and place, agents involved, or any other particualrs: no need to remember details about any specific case.

Example: Cannot cite specific cases of people driving on the right.

Coordination by precedent is the achievement of coordination by means of shared acquaintance with achievement of coordination in a single past case exactly like our present coordination problem.

By removing inessential restrictio we come to: achievement of Coordination iby means of shared acquaintance with a regularity governing  the achievement of coordination in a class of past cases which bear some conspicuous analogy to one another an to our present Coordination problem.

Our acquantince with this regularity comes from our experience with some of its instances, not necessarily the same ones for everbody.

Given a regularity in past cases, we may reasonably extrapolate it into the near future.

Each new action in conformity to regularity adds to our experience of general conformity.

Once we get the process started, we have a metastable self-perpetuating system of preferences, expectations, and actions capable of persisting indefinitely.

As long as uniform conformity is a coordination equilibrium, so that each wants to conform conditionally upeon conformity by others, conforming action produces expectation of conforming action and expectation of conforming action produces conforming action.

This is the phenomenon I call convention:

A regularity R in the behavior of member of a population P when they are agents in a recurrent situation S is a convention if and only if, in any stance of S among member of P:

1. Everyone conforms to R
2. Everyone expects everyone else to conform to R
3. Everyone prefers to conform to R on condition that the others do, since S is a coordination problem and uniform conformity to R is a proper coordination equilibrium in S

## Sample Conventions

Lots of interesting examples. Annotate later.

## Naming Conventions

> In computer programming, a fully qualified name is an unambiguous name that specifies which object, function, or variable a call refers to without regard to the context of the call.

This is obvious from a perspective of file systems (relative versus absolute).

---

Coordination needs common knowledge. This happens in games all the time. Soccer and such.

Does convention expectations attribute too much complexity to people?
