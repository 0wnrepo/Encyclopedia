Juxtaposition
================================================================================

Juxtaposition is the placement of two signs_ next to each other to create a new,
separate, meaning.

Juxtaposition can happen for many reasons:

- Desired proximity
- Undesired proximity
- Randomness / surrealism
- Unlikely proximity
- Resemblance
- Contrast
- Conflict

Juxtaposition is a very popular technique for conflicting entities.

Juxtaposition is often useful for stories with limited ambitions. However,
there are many examples of complexity resulting from conflict within a single
entity: The anti-hero, the tragic villain, "twisted" fairy tales, etc.

Comics are "Juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence,
intended to convey information and/or produce an aesthetic response in the
viewer."
