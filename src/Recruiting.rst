Recruiting in the software industry is unique because of the unique nature of
the industry itself. The job market favors employees rather than companies.

To understand how companies hire, one only needs to understand two things:

1. What companies are looking for
2. How they recognize it

In general, recruiting has five stages:

1. Job Analysis: Who are we looking for?

2. Sourcing: How do we identify potentially qualified candidates?

3. Screening: How do we identify qualified candidates?

4. Selling: How do we convince qualified candidates to join us?

4. Onboarding: How do we make new hires productive?
