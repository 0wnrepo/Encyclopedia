**Socrates** was a philosopher in `classical Greece`_.


Trial & Death
================================================================================

The trial and execution of Socrates took place in 399 BC. Socrates was tried on
two charges: corrupting the youth and impiety. More specifically, Socrates'
accusers cited two impious acts: failing to acknowledge the gods that the city
acknowledges and introducing new deities. A majority of the jurors voted to
convict him, and then voted to sentence him to death.

Socrates was a well-known figure in Athens for many years prior to his trial.
