Hortative
================================================================================

The hortative is a group of semantically similar deontic modalities in some
languages.

The term hortative dates to 1576, from Latin Latin _hortatorius_ "encouraging,
cheering".

Hortative modalities encourage or urge.

Hortative modalities signal the speaker's encouragement or discouragement toward
the addressee's bringing about the proposition of an utterance.

In English there are seven hortative modalities:

1.  Adhortative

    The adhortative encourages or urges.
    
    *   You might want to go; it'll be fun.

2.  Dehortative

    The dehortative discourages or urges against.

    *   Maybe you might not want to drive in the rain.

3.  Exhortative

    The exhortative is avidly encourages or strongly urges.

    *   You really should try the caviar! It's divine.

4.  Inhortative

    The inhortative avidly discourages or strongly urges against.

    *   No! You can't go!

5.  Suprahortative

    The suprahortative is used for pleas of encouragement or absolute urging.

    *   Please say yes! You must take this job!

6.  Infrahortative

    The infrahortative is used for pleas of discouragement or absolute urgent against.

    *   You can't do this! It's be suicide!

7.  Cohortative

    The cohortative is used for mutual encouragement or discouragement.

    *   Let's eat!
    *   Let's go for a walk after dinner.

    The cohortative is a fairly neutral modality, but can be combined with the other six hortative modalities.

    *   Come on, let's really go in the cave. (cohortative-exhortative)
    *   Please! Please, let's not go in the cave. I'm scared! (cohortative-infrahortative)

Hortatives differ by intensity and person.

Hortative modality is often mistaken for other modalities due to semantic or lexical similarities.
