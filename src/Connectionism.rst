.. pull-quote::

    Connectionism is a movement in `cognitive science`_ which hopes to explain
    human intellectual abilities using artificial `neural networks`_.

    Philosophers have become interested in connectionism because it promises to
    provide an alternative to the classical theory of the mind: the widely held
    view that the mind is something akin to a digital computer processing a
    symbolic language. Exactly how and to what extent the connectionist paradigm
    constitutes a challenge to `classicism` has been a matter of hot debate in
    recent years. - SEP

    Connectionism is a set of approaches in the fields of `artificial
    intelligence`_, cognitive psychology, `cognitive science`_, neuroscience,
    and philosophy of mind, that models mental or behavioral phenomena as the
    emergent processes of interconnected networks of simple units. There are
    many forms of connectionism, but the most common forms use `neural network`_
    models. - Wikipedia
