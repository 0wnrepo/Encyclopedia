================================================================================
Name
================================================================================

A name is an expression_ that consists of a word_ or phrase_.

A name may denote either a real thing or an imaginary thing (an idea of a
thing).

Things that we don't want to talk about rarely have names, but we refer to them
by putting together several words, each of which, by itself, might be and is
used for an indefinite number of other objects -- though context makes it clear
what is meant.

A name is an arbitrary sequence of words that serves to mark and communicate a
thought.[2]

A designator is either a proper name or a description.[3]

"All names are names of something: real or imaginary." - Mill, Of Names

    * Socrates
    * Athens
    * The Holy Roman Empire
    * The Beatles

Form
====

A word is a name if it is categorematic (that is, it expresses meaning independently).

    * "man"
    * "white"

A phrase is a name if it has a noun as its head word.

    * "a heavy body"
    * "a course of justice"

A phrase is composed of categorematic and syncategorematic words.

    @ A head word performs the same grammatical function as a phrase.

Analysis
========

A name has a referent.

The referent of a description is the object which satisfies it.[3]

Purpose
=======

Name are used to:

- Recall the likeness of a former thought
- Communicate the thought to others

Names are name of things; not merely of our ideas of thing.

.. _singular_name:

Singular Name
-------------

A name is singular iff it necessarily has a single referent.

    * "the taste of milk"            (singular abstract connotative)
    * "the color of milk"            (singular abstract connotative)
    * "milk-whiteness"               (singular abstract non-connotative)
    * "length"                       (singular abstract non-connotative)
    * "the only son of John Stiles"  (singular concrete connotative) [definite description]
    * "the first emperor of Rome"    (singular concrete connotative) [definite description]
    * "John"                         (singular concrete non-connotative) [proper]
    * "Dartmouth"                    (singular concrete non-connotative) [proper]

General Name
------------

A name is a general name iff it not a singular name.

    * "fault"                        (general abstract connotative)
    * "possible"                     (general abstract connotative)
    * "color"                        (general abstract non-connotative)
    * "attribute"                    (general abstract non-connotative)
    * "man"                          (general concrete connotative) [indefinite description]
    * "white"                        (general concrete connotative) [indefinite description]
    * "a Beatle"                     (general concrete non-connotative)
    * "a Rockefeller"                (general concrete non-connotative)

    @ A general name denotes not the class of individuals, but every individual.

    * "The sun" is general since it is capable of being predicate of many things, but accidentally is singular.
    * "God" is general since it is capable of being predicate of many things, but accidentally is singular.

Concrete Name
-------------

A name is concrete iff it can be predicated of substances.

    * "the only son of John Stiles"  (singular concrete connotative) [definite description]
    * "the first emperor of Rome"    (singular concrete connotative) [definite description]
    * "John"                         (singular concrete non-connotative) [proper]
    * "Dartmouth"                    (singular concrete non-connotative) [proper]
    * "man"                          (general concrete connotative) [indefinite description]
    * "white"                        (general concrete connotative) [indefinite description]
    * "a Beatle"                     (general concrete non-connotative)
    * "a Rockefeller"                (general concrete non-connotative)

Abstract Name
-------------

An name is abstract iff it can be predicated of attributes.

    * "the taste of milk"            (singular abstract connotative)
    * "the color of milk"            (singular abstract connotative)
    * "milk-whiteness"               (singular abstract non-connotative)
    * "length"                       (singular abstract non-connotative)
    * "fault"                        (general abstract connotative)
    * "possible"                     (general abstract connotative)
    * "color"                        (general abstract non-connotative)
    * "attribute"                    (general abstract non-connotative)

    @property `(if (and (concrete x) (general x)) (connotative x))` [Mill]
    @me This is false.

    @issue Substances are not all that exists; attributes, given that we can speak of them must be said to exist; feelings exists
    @issue Are attribute substances? (no, attributes and feelings are not)
    @issue Are attribute beings? (See: problem of universals)
    @issue "being" and "substance" have non-usful connotation, so we use "entity"

Connotative Name
----------------

A name is connotative iff it implies an attribute of it referents.

SEE: Connotation

    * "the only son of John Stiles"  (singular concrete connotative) [definite description]
    * "the first emperor of Rome"    (singular concrete connotative) [definite description]
    * "man"                          (general concrete connotative) [indefinite description]
    * "white"                        (general concrete connotative) [indefinite description]
    * "the taste of milk"            (singular abstract connotative)
    * "the color of milk"            (singular abstract connotative)
    * "fault"                        (general abstract connotative)
    * "possible"                     (general abstract connotative)
    @ A connotative name does not denote its attributes; it denotes what it can be affirmed of.

Non-Connotative Name
--------------------

A name is non-connotative iff it is not connotative.

    * "John"                         (singular concrete non-connotative) [proper]
    * "Dartmouth"                    (singular concrete non-connotative) [proper]
    * "a Beatle"                     (general concrete non-connotative)
    * "a Rockefeller"                (general concrete non-connotative)
    * "milk-whiteness"               (singular abstract non-connotative)
    * "length"                       (singular abstract non-connotative)
    * "color"                        (general abstract non-connotative)
    * "attribute"                    (general abstract non-connotative)

    @ Non-connotative names are defined ostensively or enumeratively; consequently, their connotation and denotation is the same.
    @ Non-connotative names denote things with which we can have [direct acquaintance].

Positive Name
-------------

A name is positive iff its referent has the attributes the name connotes.

    * "man" is positive
    * "white" is positive

Negative Name
-------------

A name is negative iff it is not positive.

    * "not-man" is negative
    * "not-white" is negative

    @ Every positive name has a corresponding negative name.
    @ When a positive name is connotative, so is the negative, although in the absence ("non-white")

    @ Certain names are positive though negative in practice, e.g. "Inconvenient" - It means not "not convenient" but the cause of discomfort

    @ME: Is this is meaningful... Or useful?
    @ME: It seems to cover gradable words. That is, 'immoral' == 'not mortal' but 'inconvenient' != 'not convenient' (there is a middle in the second one)
    @ME: Basically, this claims the existence of just "opposites" for every word.

Univocal Name 
-------------

A name is univocal iff it connotes a single thing.

    * "Entomology" connotes "the study of insects"

Equivocal Name
--------------

A name is equivocal iff it connotes multiple things.

    * "Chihuahua" connotes either 'a breed of dog' or 'a state of Mexico'.

    @ An equivocal word is two names accidentally coinciding in sound.

Countable Name
--------------

A name is countable iff its referent is countable.

    * "The vegetables"
    * "Ten peas" (historical accident)
    @ A countable name may be singular or plural.

        * "The dog is barking."
        * "The dogs are barking."
        * "I want a dog."
        * "I want dogs."

Uncountable Name
----------------

A name is uncountable iff any quantity of its reference is treated the same.

    * "The fruit"
    * "The corn"

In many languages, liquids, powder, and substances are uncountable nouns.

    * "The sand" (powder)
    * "The gravel" (powder)
    * "The water" (liquid)
    * "The milk" (liquid)
    * "The wood" (substance)
    * "The paper" (substance)

However, (un)countablity is a property of words themselves, since there are exceptions.

    * "The furniture"
    * "The cutlery"
    * "The music"
    * "The electricity"
    * "The advice"

Uncountable nouns are usually treated as singular but there are exceptions.

    * "The news is important"
    * "Your luggage looks heavy"
    * "The scissors look sharp" (exception)

Countable names can be used with indefinite articles .

    * "A dog"

Generally, uncountable names cannot be used with indefinite articles.

    * "A sand"
    * "A (glass of) water" is acceptable when ordering

Countable names can be counted directly.

    * "Twenty chairs"

Uncountable names cannot be counted directly.
Uncountable names must specify a unit of measurement (or partitive).

    * "A grain of sand"
    * "A bucket of sand"
    * "A slice of bread"
    * "A loaf of bread"
    * "A tablespoon of sugar"
    * "Twenty pieces of furniture"
    * "A pair of jeans"

We use "few" and "many" with countable nouns.

    * "I want a few kids"
    * "I want many kids"

We use "little" and "much" with uncountable nouns:

    * "I want a little water"
    * "I want much water"

Some words change countability and meaning based on context.

    * ("A light", "Light")
    * ("A paper", "Paper")
    * ("A room", "Room")

Deictic Name
------------

A name is deictic iff its denotation varies depending on the context (time, place, speaker).

Deictic names are singular.

    * "Your dogs"

Deictic names include:

1. Pronouns
2. Demonstrative 
3. Possessive

@ME: I'm going to leave this mostly untreated.

### Demonstrative

A name is demonstrative iff it is non-connotative.

    * "this" (singular)
    * "that"
    * "these" (collective)
    * "those"

Demonstratives may be either abstract or concrete.

    * "This story is great." (concrete)
    * ...

Privative Name
--------------

A name is privative iff it connotes the absence of a once had or expected attribute.

    * "blind", which is not just "not seeing" else we could apply it to stones
    * "dead" means once alive

Collective Name
---------------

A name is collective iff its referent is a collection.

    * "The couple"
    * "The pile"
    * "The 76th regiment of foot in the British Army"
    * "The class was startled by the bursting light bulb."
    * "A regiment" (general)

Generic Name
------------

A name is generic iff its referent is a class (or type or form).

    * "The whale is a mammal"
    * "Man is a rational animal"

Relative Name
-------------

A name is relative (or converse) iff it denotes an object and it implies the existence of another object.

    * ("parent", "child")
    * ("borrow", "lend")
    * ("above", "below")

    @ Both terms in a relation connote the same thing, since the proposition expressed is the same.

Canonical Name
--------------

A name is canonical if it is general, non-connotative, and non-deictic.

    * "the Classics"
    * "countries of the world"

Proper Name
-----------

A name is proper iff it is a singular concrete non-connotative name.

    * "Aristotle"
    * "John Locke"
    * (a child by the name) "Paul" (Mill)
    * (a dog by the name) "Caesar" (Mill)
    * "Dartmouth" (Mill)

    @ Proper names are independent on any attribute of the object.

    * Though a town may have a name because it's near a river (Dartmouth), if the river disappears it keeps its name.
    ! It can be said there there is a reason we gave some name other than others.
Rebuttal: The name, once given, is independent of reason.
        * A man may have been named John after his father, but it is not part of the signification of the word John. 
        * It would not be a contradiction to say Dartmouth did not lie at Dart's mouth.[3]

Russel divides proper names into:

1. Logical (this, that, these, those)
2. Ordinary (John, Dartmouth)

Description
-----------

A description is a referential expression (or denoting phrase or denoting complex).

A description is a singular noun phrase, preceded by a quantifier, whose predicate term is satisfied by some particular.

A description is sometimes called a name.

    * "the man"
    * "a man"
    * "any man"
    * "some man"
    * "every man"
    * "all men"
    * "the present King of England"
    * "the present King of France"
    * "the center of mass of the solar system at the first instant of the twentieth century"
    * "the revolution of the earth round the sun"
    * "the revolution of the sun round the earth"

    @ A phrase is denoting solely in virtue of its form.

Definite Description
--------------------

A description is definite iff it is a singular connotative name.

A description is definite iff it has the form `the X`.

    * "The president of the United States"

"the" involves uniqueness.

```
>>> (define (uniquely P x) (and (P x) (forall (y) (if (P y) (== y x)))))
>>> (meaning "the father of Charles II was executed")
(exists (x)
        (and (uniquely (fathered 'Charles II') x)
             (executed x)))
```

Definite descriptions, e.g. "The X is A", translates to:

1. There is some thing X
2. At most one thing is X
3. Everything that is X is A

Proper Definite Description
---------------------------

2. A phrase may denote one definite object ("the present President of the USA")

A definite description is proper iff it denotes one definite object.

    * "The first president of the United States"

A phrase may denote one definite object (proper definite)

A definite description is proper if it has a denotation.


    * "The sun"
    * "The first emperor of Rome"

Improper Definite Description
-----------------------------

1. A phrase may be denoting but not denote anything ("the present King of France")

A definite description is improper iff it denotes multiple things or if it denotes no thing.

    * "The senator from Ohio" (since there are two senators)
    * "The present king of France" (since France has not present King)

A phrase may be denoting and not denote anything (improper definite)

A definite description is improper if it has no denotation or denotes ambiguously.

    * "The Senator from Ohio"

Indefinite Description
----------------------

A description is indefinite if it denotes ambiguously.

    * "a man" denotes not many men, but an ambiguous man
    * "some men" denotes not many men, but an ambiguous group of men

A phrase may denote ambiguously (indefinite)

Indefinite descriptions, e.g. "An X is A", translates to:

1. There is some thing X
2. Everything that is X is A

# Meaning

No denoting phrase has meaning in isolation. A denoting phrase is a part of a sentence.

Every proposition in whose verbal expression a denoting phrase occurs has a meaning.

No denoting phrase is a constituent in the verbal expression of the proposition in which it occurs. Rather, every denoting phrases expresses a propositional function (:: Thing -> Proposition).

    * (meaning "everything is P") == (forall (x) (P x))
    * (meaning "something is P")  == (exists (x) (P x))
                                     == (not (forall (x) (not (P x))))
    * (meaning "nothing is P")    == (forall (x) (not (P x)))
                                     == (not (exists (x) (P x)))

    * (meaning "all Xs are P")   == (forall (x) (if (X x) (P x)))
    * (meaning "every X is P")   == (forall (x) (if (X x) (P x)))

    * (meaning "some Xs are P")  == (exists (x) (and (X x) (P x)))
    * (meaning "a X is P")       == (exists (x) (and (X x) (P x)))

    * (meaning "no X is P")      == (forall (x) (if (X x) (not (P x))))

    * (meaning "I met a man")        == (exists (x) (and ('I met' x) (man x)))
    * (meaning "all men are mortal") == (forall (x) (if (man x) (mortal x)))


# Refutation

# Denoting phrase as constituent

Some theories posit that denoting phrases are constituents of the propositions in which they appear; denoting phrases stand for an object.

    * "The present King of France" stands for an object
    * "The round square" stands for an object

## Meinong

Claim: Since non-existent things could be referred to, they must have some sort of being, termed "being so", which is different from existence.

    * A unicorn
    * Pegasus
    * The golden mountain
    * The round square

    @ "Meinong's Jungle" is the name give to the repository of non-existent entities in the ontology of Alexius Meinong by Walliam C. Kneale whose 'Probability and Induction' (1949) which included the passage: "after wandering in Meinong's jungle of subsistence... philosophers are now agreed that propositions cannot be regarded as ultimate entities".

    ! Raises ontological difficulties
    ! Violates law of contradiction

    * The King of France exists and does not exist.
    * The round square is round and is also not round.

Claim: Objects which do not exist do not obey law of contradiction
    ! We would like to avoid this

## Frege

Frege avoided Meinong's claims.

Claim: A denoting phrase consists of a sense (meaning) and reference (denotation).

    * "the center of mass of the solar system" is complex in sense, but its reference is a certain point, which is simple.

Claim: Denoting phrases are constituents of the meaning of a proposition.

    * In "Mont Blanc is over 1,000 meters high", the meaning of "Mont Blanc", not the actual mountain, is a constituent of the meaning of the proposition.

    ! When the denotation is absent

    * It would seem that "The King of England is bald" is not a statement about the meaning of "the King of England" but about the actual man denoted by the meaning.

Claim: "The King of France is bald" should be nonsense, since there is no denotation.

    ! "The King of France is bald" is false.

Claim: Expressions which have no denotation denote conventionally

    * We define "the King of France" to denote the null-class
    * We define "the only son of Mr. So-and-so" (who has a family of ten) to denote the class of all his sons.

    ! Does not lead to logical error, but is plainly artificial
    ! Does not given exactly analysis of the matter

# Relation of meaning to denotation

The meaning of a denoting phrase

    * The center of mass of the solar system is a point
    * 'The center of mass of the solar system' is a denoting complex

    * The first line of Gray's Elegy states a proposition
    * 'The first line of Gray's Elegy' does not state a proposition (is a denoting complex)

Let C be a denoting complex.

The meaning of C is the meaning of the denotation of C.

    * 'The meaning of the first line of Gray's Elegy' is the same as 'The meaning of "The curfew tolls the knell of parting day"'.
    * `(meaning (GRAYS_ELEGY.read()[0])) == (meaning ("The curfew tolls the knell of parting day."))`
    * `(meaning ("GRAYS_ELEGY.read()[0]")) != (meaning ("The curfew tolls the knell of parting day."))`

The meaning of 'C' is the meaning of C.

### Names

Saying that proper names don't refer to things, but instead refer to a predicate to which one thing can satisfy is sensible. Said another way, _names_ are convenient descriptions of things.

Classes too are not things, but sets of things possessing certain properties.

- To say X is a Y is to say X has all of the essential properties of Y.
- To say X is Y, is to say Y(X), or X has property Y. (Apples are red == Apples has the property of redness.) Apples are fruits is better written Apples are a Fruit.


Russel wants to decompose proper names into "The exists some x, such that P(X), (Q(x), ..., Z(x)" where the set of predicates define its essence. That's all and well, but what if a thing has no essence? (Can a person be indefinite?)


Russell doesn't think that "Pegasus does not exist" is a valid sentence for a few reasons (for one, existence is not a predicate) but perhaps the more important one is that he thinks that references must point to actual things. This is a shot against idealism. Whereas Frege has references pointing to abstract ideas (intensions), Russel thinks they must ultimately point to real things (extension).

Thus, these points require a context.

> This is the principle of the theory of denoting I wish to advocate: that denoting phrases never have any meaning in themselves, but that every proposition in whose verbal expression they occur has a meaning.

Russel wants to make the point that denoting phrases do not merely refer to objects-- for it often the case that they do not actually refer to anything. For instance 'the present King of France' or 'the round square' are not genuine objects. This of course falls prey to the law of contradiction. (This theory is posited by Meinong)

### Translation

> My theory, briefly, is as follows. I take the notion of the variable as fundamental; I use 'C(x)' to mean a proposition in which x is a constituent, where x, the variable, is essentially and wholly undetermined. Then we can consider the two notions 'C(x) is always true' and 'C(x) is sometimes true'. Then everything and nothing and something (which are the most primitive of denoting phrases) are to be interpreted as follows: 

> C(everything) means 'C(x) is always true'; 
> C(nothing) means '"C(x) is false" is always true'; 
> C(something) means 'It is false that "C(x) is false" is always true.'

The first,  "C(x) is always true"            means "forall x, C(x) == true"
The second, "'C(x) is false' is always true" means "forall x, C(x) == false"
The third,  "C(x) is sometimes true"         means "!(forall x, C(x) == false)" or "exists x, C(x)"

> Here the notion 'C(x) is always true' is taken as ultimate and indefinable, and the others are defined by means of it. Everything, nothing, and something are not assumed to have any meaning in isolation, but a meaning is assigned to every proposition in which they occur.

        - May be able to point things out ostensively (Russel's acquaintance)
    - Sometimes we discover two names have the same referent
    - Did Aristotle every exist?
        - Would be meaningless under
        - Meaning of phrase if it someone who satisfies descriptions
- Not obvious how to answer each of these arguments
- Nevertheless Kripke thinks Frege and Russel are wrong
- Many people have claimed Frege and Russel are wrong
    - Use notion of a cluster concept
    - Frege points out that for genuine proper names, senses diverge
    - It must not be that a name stands for its description otherwise "Aristotle was the man who taught Alexander the Great" would be tauatological
    - Consider the example in Philosophical Investigations
        - If one says "Moses did not exist" this may mean various things
            - The Israelites did not have a single leader when they withdrew from Egypt
            - Their leader was not called Moses
            - There cannot have been anyone who accomplished all the Bible relates of Moses
        - When making a statement, is it enough to substitute just one of those descriptions?
        - How much would need to be proved false to claim that Moses did not exist?
        - Does the name Moses have a fixed an univocal use?
- There are two ways in which the cluster concept theory or the theory requires a single description can be viewed
    1. The cluster or single description actually gives the meaning of the name
        "Walter Scott" means "the man such that such and such and such."
    2. The description doesn't give the meaning, but it determines the reference
        "Walter Scott" is not synonymous with "the man such that such and such and such."
        - If the description ends up refering to Salvador Dali, then the reference will be wrong
        - Some writers deny that names have meaning at all
            - Paul Ziff, names have no meaning at all and are not a part of language
        - This view falls prey to the problems Mill has (and the Moses one)
- Recall distinction of categories of truth
    - 'a priori' is concept of epistemology; back to Kant: those which can be known independent of experience; but, possible for whom? For God? For Maritans? Or for people with minds like our?
    - it is not true that 'a priori' means _must_ be known independent from experience
        - a number could generate an unfamiliar prime number, which could be known without experience, but we know it through experience
    - recall necessity
        - sometimes used just like a priori
        - sometimes distinguished between physical and logical
        - we're concerned with notion of metaphysics
            - we can ask something might have been true or might have been false
            - if something is false, it obviously is not necessarily true
            - if something is true, might it have been otherwise?
                - if no, then it is necessary
                - if yes, then it is contigent
- half assed here
    - some issues on the distinction / refutations
- Nixon-- did he win continentally or essentially?
    - is the guy who the election of 1968? or could someone else have?
    - that is, which properties are well-defined for identity?
- adequate necessary and sufficient conditions for identity are rare
    - mathematics is the only case where they are given even within a possible world
    - none for things over time or people
- we cannot observe identity directly, only properties on an individual
    - so when dealing with possible world, we need a better of telling who is who to identify people in them
- a possible world is given by the descriptive conditions we associate with it
- a thing is a rigid designator if in every possible world it designates the same object
- a thing is a nonrigid (accidental) designator if that is not the case
- a thing need not always exist
    - Nixon might not exist if his parents hadnt gotten marrried
- an essential property is one that is true of that object in any case where it would have exist
- a rigid designator of a necessary existent can be called strongly rigid
- (proper) names are rigid designator
    - Nixon must be Nixon, regardless of election outcome
    - "the President in 1970" designates Nixon, but someone might have been the President, so the designator is not rigid
- because we have designator we can talk about transworld identity
- things are not "found out" about a counterfactual situation; they are stipulated
- possible world need not be given purely qualitatively
    - could not refer to "this table" only "a table with these properties..."
- it is sometimes argued that if a description of a world cannot be reduced to qualities, then some bare particulars must be assumed, propertyless substrata underlying qualities.
    - Kripke denies that a particular is nothing but a bundle of qualities
        - if a quality is an abstract object, then a bundle of qualities is higher degree of abstract, not a particular
            - this means we identify objects in the world not in terms of qualities
    - Philosopher ask: "Are these object behind the bundle of qualities, or is the object nothing but the bundle?" but this a false dilemma
- Wittgenstein claims "There is one thing of which one cay neither that is one meter long nor that it is not one meter long, and that is the standard meter in Paris"
- If the reference of a name is given by a description or cluster of descriptions (if it means the same) it will not be a rigid designator since some other objects might have had the given properties on other possible worlds.
    - If Aristotle is the greatest man to study with Plato, someone could be
    - It is not contradictory to say suppose Aristotle didn't study philosophy, since it means "that man"
- Frege uses "sense" in two senses
    1. The sense of a designator is its meaning
    2. The sense of a designator is the way the reference is determined
- Frege supposes that bother are given by definite descriptions
- Kripke reject both of Frege's claims
- PI is not "the ration of the circumference of a circle to its diameter" but a real number, which is necessarily so
    - PI and "the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter" are rigid designators
- Strawson
    - A name is not a disguised description
    - Name is defined as cluser of descriptions
    - Moses had disjunction of descriptions
        - Could not be counterfactual situation in which he didn't do any
- Searle
    - Why do we have proper names at all? - Obviously to refer
    - Can't we just use descriptions?
        - Yes, but at cost of specifying identity conditions each time
- Length of meter is contigent truth
- Searle
    - Properties
        - To every name or designation expression 'X', there corresponds a cluster of properties namely the family of properties P such that A believes 'P X'
        - One of the properties, or some conjointly, are believed by A to pick out some individual uniquely
        - If most, or a weighted most, of the P's are satisfied by one unique object, y, then y is the referent of 'X'
- Cannot do something like "the Bible relates of X such and such" since the problem of reference is throw back to the question of reference in the Bible
    - We note, the account must not be circular. The properties used in the vote must not involve the notion of reference


# Lecture 2. January 22, 1970

Theses:

1. To every name or designating expression, 'X', there corresponds a cluster of properties, namely the family of those properties P such that A believes 'P X'
2. One of those properties, or some conjointly, are believed by A to pick out some individual uniquely
3. If most, or a weighted most, of the P's are satisfied by one unique object `y` then `y` is the referent of 'X'.
4. If the vote yield no unique object, 'X' does not refer.
5. The statement, "If X exists, then X has most of the P's" is known a_priori by the speaker.
6. The statement, "If X exists, then X has most of the P's expresses a necessary truth (in the idiolect of the speaker"
C. For any successful theory, the account must not be circular. The properties which are used in the vote of must not themselves involve the notion of reference in such a way that it is ultimately impossible to eliminate.

Note: C is not a thesis, but a condition on the satisfaction of the other theses.

Note: When I say a designator is rigid, and designates the same thing in all possible world, I mean that, as used in our language, it stands for that thing, when we talk about counterfactual situations.

---

## Thesis 1

1. To every name or designating expression, 'X', there corresponds a cluster of properties, namely the family of those properties P such that A believes 'P X'

This is a definition.

## Thesis 2

2. One of those properties, or some conjointly, are believed by A to pick out some individual uniquely

Example: "I shall use the term 'Cicero' to denote the man who first denounced Catiline in public."

Is this true?
Intuition: Seem a_priori because if you don't think that the properties you have in your mind pick out anyone uniquely then how can you say which one of them you're talking about?
    Example: Say all sets of properties you pick out are satisfied by two people
    Note: Usually the properties in question are supposed to be famous deed of the person in question.
    Note: Most people when they think of Cicero just think "a famous Roman orator" without pretension to think that there was only one or that must know something him to have a referent for the name.
    Note: Most people when they think of Feynman just think "a famous physicist" without pretension to think that there was only one or that must know something him to have a referent for the name.
    Note: With our definition of Cicero, we introduced Catiline and must avoid circularity.
        Note: People commonly fail to do this.
            Example: Einstein invented the theory of relativity and the theory of relativity was the theory invented by Einstein.
    Note: "Feynman is a famous physicist" fails without attributing anything else to Feynman

Thesis 2 is false because it permits circularity.

## Thesis 3

3. If most, or a weighted most, of the P's are satisfied by a unique object `y` then `y` is the referent of 'X'.

Put aside the issue of circularity.

Example: Consider that Gödel is believed to have discovered the incompleteness of arithmetic but actually it was discovered by a man named Schmidt. Then when we say "the man who discovered the incompleteness of arithmetic" do we refer to Gödel or Schmidt? Kripke claims Godel. One could of course change the description, but the point remains that a description could be incorrect.
Example: Imagine a man believed Peano did P, talks about Peano as if he did P, and then discovered Dedekind did P. Was he referring to Peano or Dedekind?
    This can be extended to a bunch of misconceptions.
        - Einstein invented the atomic bomb.
        - Columbus was the first man to realize the Earth was round. (actually some Greek)
        - Columbus was the first man to land in the western hemisphere. (actually some Norseman)


- It doesn't help to say that "X is the man we commonly attribute Y to" for reasons of circularirty.

- Passing the buck may work, but it could come around in a circle.

So Thesis 3 is false.

## Thesis 4

4. If the vote yield no unique object, 'X' does not refer.

- The vote many not yield a unique object.
    Example: Cicero or Feynman
- The vote many yield no object.

Neither one means the name does not refer. In the same way that you may have false belief which are true of someone else, you may have false beliefs which are true of no person.

Consider Jonah.

- There was no man who was ever swallowed by a big fish or who went to Nineveh to preach.
    - These conditions are true of nobody.
    - Nevertheless, Jonah has a referent.

So Thesis 4 is false.

## Thesis 5

5. The statement, "If X exists, then X has most of the P's" is known a_priori true for the speaker.

Example: If we use "Hesperus" to name the heavenly body seen in the evening, it is not necessary that Hesperus was ever seen in the evening.
    Note: It may be a_priori in that this is how I determined the referent.

Claim: (5) has a converse. "If some thing most of the P's, it is X"" is known a_priori by the speaker.
Support: (1)-(4)
Conclusion: It is a_priori and necessary that "Something is X if and only if it uniquely has the most of the properties P"

Even if 3 and 4 are true, a typical speaker hardly know a_priori that they are, as required by the theory.

Example: I _think_ that my belief about Godel is in fact correct and that the 'Schmidt' story is just a fantasy. But this is not a_priori knowledge.

## Thesis 6

6. The statement, "If X exists, then X has most of the P's expresses a necessary truth (in the idiolect of the speaker"

Note: Has a converse.
Note: Talked about in lecture 1.

Observation: If the cluster of properties associated with a proper name is taken in a very narrow sense, so that only one property is given any weight at all, then certain things will seem to turn out to be necessary truths with which are not necessary truth. (Many)
Example: Take the definite description: "Aristotle was the philosopher who taught Alexander the Great". Then it seems necessary that Aristotle taught Alexander the Great.
Objection: It is contingent that Aristotle ever went into pedagogy. (Searle)
Conclusion: One must drop the original paradigm of a single descriptions.

Claim: It is a necessary fact that a name has the logical sum, injunctive disjunction, of properties commonly attributed to it. (Searle)
Objection: It is not a necessary truth that Aristotle had the properties commonly attributed to him.
    Rebuttal: Forms of determinism
        Rebuttal: Simpler to believe world is not deterministic
    Claim: Commonly attributed properties of Aristotle are contingent.
    Claim: Commonly attributed properties of Hitler are contingent.
        Claim: Hitler is not the man who had the most Jews killed.
            We use this statement to pick out the reference of the name, but in a counterfactual situation, we would not say that another man who gained this discredit is Hitler.
            That Hitler had the most Jews killed is contingent on the fact that he came to power.
    Claim: If we define a meter by reference to the standard meter stick, it is contingent that the particular stick is one meter long. (if it had been stretched (e.g. by heat) it would no longer be one meter)
        We use the term "one meter" to rigidly designate a certain length.
        We fix that length by an accidental property of that length similar to how we pick a man out by an accidental property of that man.

@me: We do this in programming a lot; computing values and storing them in names

So, we get to identifies by accidental properties.
Example: The length of a yard was the distance between the tip of King Henry I of England and his nose.

Claim: The most important properties are those properties used to identify the object in the actual world.
Note: We say the most important properties of Aristotle consist in his philosophical work.
Note: We say the most important properties of Hitler consist in his murderous political role.
Note: These properties are contingent.
Conclusion: Important properties need not be essential

Conclusion: Thesis 6 must be incorrect. (No effect on other Thesis.)

## Notes

5 and 6 say that sufficiently reflective speaker grasp this theory of proper names.

## Non-circularity condition

Premise: It is not trifling to be told that Socrates was the greatest philosopher of ancient Greece.
Premise: It is     trifling to be told that Socrates was called "Socrates" (Kneale)
Conclusion: 'Socrates' means 'the individual called "Socrates"'
Note: Russel gives a similar analysis
Note: Stated using the past tense, the condition wouldn't be circular (I refer to X as the man called X by Y)
    Example: Maybe the Greeks didn't call Socrates 'Socrates'

On the other hand:

Claim: It is     trifling to be told that Socrates is called "Socrates" (Kneale)
Note: Not necessary are analytic

Example: I shall use the term "Glunk" to refer to the man that I call "Glunk" is blatantly circular
Lemma: There is a way of determining the reference of a name independent of the fact that it bears that name

Note: 'X' must mean something for 'X is called "X"' to be true

---

If Thesis 6 is reject, then we get:
    1. I want to name an object.
    2. I think of some way describing it uniquely.
    3. One announces that the object denoted by 2 has name X.
        X refers to the objected that in fact 2
    4. Now we can speak of world in which X did not have 2

NOTES, 10/15

Misdescription
    Break Strawson's premise
    Descriptions don't depend on whether they are correct
        Big problem for Russel

Kripke claims that Donellan doesn't refute Russel
Kripke wants to show that Donellan's argue are inadequate, but Frege and Russel are wrong
Kripke's goal is to undermine Donellan's argument
    - Focus on Russel, but same point can be made against Strawon
- Distinction between referential and attributive is ...

That misinformation is applied to Christopher Columbus doesn't mean that we refer to Leif Ericonson.

Kripke: Thinks the distinction between names and definite description
There is no denial that there is a distnction between attribute use and referential use
Reject Russel's semantics for names

Distinction between singular proposition vs general proposition exists, but literal

Goal in paper is mostly methodological; Kripke doesn't want to take a stand

Distinction:

> What is said by use of S [Semantic Reference; what is meant in a language]
> What is implicated by a use of S (Grice, not logical implication) [Speaker Reference; what is meant on an occasion]

A Caual Theory of Perception

- Suppose magician is performing trick.
    - Oh my God the glass _looks_ red.
        - Communicates you're not certain (or that is isnt) red.
- Thieves are stealing something
    - Cops are coming
    - Says officers are coming this way
    - Implicates we should split/run

Semantics may not be independent of pragmatics.

Donellan talks like his distinction have semantic importance

Everybody loves somebody

Russell didn't appreciate pragmatics.

Pick Strawson or Russel for semantics. Donellan points out meaning can be over and above.

That man is drinking a martini (actually water).

In some words are ambiguous, we should find in other languages that they are not.

But we don't find Strawson and Russel distinctions (ambiguous), we should find a distinction other langueas.

IM AT PAGE 90

Ambiguity,

Polysemy = single word form expresses different but related meaning
    - Murdoch bought the NYT (the paper or corporation)
    - Mass or count noun

Language change
    - Tweet
    - Google (denominal)
    - Houdidin (nominalization)

SUMMARY

Russel is right at the leave of speaker meaning, but didn't appreciate speaker meaning. Donellan drew attention the capacity to communicate two kind of proposition with definite descriptions and inferred that Russel must be wrong. Donella is just conflating semantics and pragmatics. To argue against Russell, Donella has to argue against semantics though.


Kripke agrees betwee referential and attributive. Donellan says Russel is wrong aboust semantics reference

Language is a rational action. There are goals. Care about referring.

# Proper Name

A name is proper if it is singular, non-connotative, and non-deictic.

Example: "London"
Example: "England"

# Identification

Proper names are capitalized.


# Properties

## Non-connotative

A proper name is defined extensively (that is, by specifying the particulars it denotes, rather than any attribute common to them).

As non-connotative, learning a proper name does not imply attributes of an object and hence nothing is learned. (As a definition, it is tautological.)

> When we predicate of anything its proper name; when we say, pointing to a man, this is Brown or Smith, or pointing to a city, that it is York, we do not, merely by so doing, convey to the hearer any information about them, except that those are their names. (Mill)

@ME: Frege's argument refutes the point, because Mill is claiming that the mark does not have information about it. Deliberately.

Nevertheless, Clark Kent and Superman seem to refer to the identical person in a different way.
I guess one could say that "Superman" doesn't denote superman because "Superman is a man who can fly". Similarly, "Dartmouth" doesn't denote Dartmouth because it near a river.

# Purpose

# Refutation

Claim: Proper names are non-connotative. (Mill, On Names)

Example: "Hesperus is Phosphorous" contains information that "Hesperus is Hesperus" doesn't
Example: "Superman is Clark Kent" contains information that "Superman is Superman" doesn't

@ME: This seems to be because connotation forms not through extension, but through observation. That is, we observe Hesperus during the day and Phosphorous and night, so they have a different connotation. Likewise, Superman is always seen in a cape, and Clark Kent with glasses.
    @ME: Could we argue they despite being identical are different things..?
@ME: Does Frege's puzzle demonstrate that proper nouns connote? Or only that they connote when there are aliases? (Do non-aliases proper names connote?)
    @ME: Does Superman connote a flying man even if we didn't know Clark Kent?
@ME: Is there a relation to Grice's maxims of implicature? It seems despite referring to the same thing, we use names for different reasons. So Frege's puzzle is possibly one of pragmatic meaning.

A proper name is not a part of the object it denotes.

A proper name is given to an object to denote it.

A proper name stands for the object it denotes. (handle)

So there are two solutions to this:

1. Names have a sense and reference.
2. Names are just sense.

> By enabling him to identify the individuals, we may connect them with information previously possessed by him; by saying, This is York, we may tell him that it contains the Minster. But this is in virtue of what he has previously heard concerning York; not by anything implied in the name. It is otherwise when objects are spoken of by connotative names. When we say, The town is built of marble, we give the hearer what may be entirely new information, and this merely by the signification of the many-worded connotative name, “built of marble.” Such names are not signs of the mere objects, invented because we have occasion to think and speak of those objects individually; but signs which accompany an attribute: a kind of livery in which the attribute clothes all objects which are recognised as possessing it. They are not mere marks, but more, that is to say, significant marks; and the connotation is what constitutes their significance.

@ME: This is borderline pragmatics.

---

Critique of "Of Names"
    - It is unclear from Mill's account how we understand a sentence containing a proper name given that it is non-connotative.
    - Can one understand a sentence containing a name one has never heard before?
    - Can one understand a sentence containing a name of a thing one has never experienced? e.g. "Let x be a number."
    - How do understand sentences containing singular abstract non-connotative names such as "squarness" given that we have no direct acquaintance.

---

Notes:

1. Names are rigid.
2. Descriptions are not rigid
3. If e is rigid and ex is not, e doesn't mean the same as ex.

---

- Sunday (where does that fit in our theory of names). It is is general and
  non-connotative, but neither a substance nor attribute.
