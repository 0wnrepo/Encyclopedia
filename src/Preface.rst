Preface
================================================================================

A preface is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the
work's author.

An introductory work written by a different person is a `foreword` and precedes
an author's preface.

A preface generally covers the story how the book came into being, or how the
idea for the book was developed; this is often followed by thanks and
acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of
writing.
