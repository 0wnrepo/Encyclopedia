Communicative act
================================================================================

A communicative act is is an act that has performative function in communication.

    * Utterance
    * Body language

Properties:

Three types of communicative acts seem to be universal:

1. Assertion
2. Question
3. Order (and Request)

### Identification

What is the difference between regarding an object as instance of linguistic communication and not so regarding it?

    *   Consider a mark on a piece of paper.
    
        - If we take it as an instance of linguistic communication (a message), then we assume it was produced by a being with certain kind of intentions.
        - If we take it as natural phenomenon, like a strain on the paper, we exclude it from the class of linguistic communication, even if the mark may be indistinguishable from a written word.

        So, linguistic communication must be intentional.[2]

Furthermore, it must be of a special kind of intention peculiar to speech acts.

    *   Consider an arrangement of furniture.

        It is possible to communicate by arranging items of furniture in certain ways.

        However, the attitude one would have to such an arrangement to understand it would be different from the regular attitude to an arrangement of furniture in the room, even though in both cases we might regard the arrangement as a result of intentional behavior.[2]

### Analysis

A speech act acts at several levels at once.[6]

Uttering words is performing utterance acts.[8]
Referring and predicating are propositional acts.[8]
Stating, questions, commanding, promisng, etc are illocutionary acts.[8]

These acts happen simultaneously, but not separately.[8] In peforming an illocutionary act, one characteristically performs propositional acts and utterance acts.[8]

Consider when Paul says to Jean, "Please sit down." He is doing these things among others:

1. Phonetic Act:        Paul is producing the noises that constitute "Please sit down"
2. Phatic act:          Paul is uttering the words of "Please sit down"
3. Rhetic act:          Paul is using his words with a certain sense and reference
4. Locutionary act:     Paul is saying to Jean, "Please sit down"
5. Illocutionary act:   Paul is asking Jean to sit down
6. Perlocutionary act:  Paul is getting Jean to sit down

The acts bear important relations to one another:

- Perlocutionary acts are performed by performing illocutionary acts
- Illocutionary acts are performed in locutionary acts.[1]
    *   Paul will have succeeded in asking Jean to sit down (the illocutionary act) when she recognizes what he wants. Jean could recognize that he wants her to sit down (successful illocutionary act) yet refuse to sit down (unsuccessful perlocutionary act).
