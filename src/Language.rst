Language
================================================================================

Language is the human capacity for acquiring and using complex systems of
communication_.

Language is a versatile medium for communication.

Languages can be thought of as an evolutionary adaption.

A language consists of a lexicon_ and a grammar_.

----

A language is a set of sentences, each (1) of finite length and (2) constructed
out a finite alphabet of symbols.

Example: If `A` is an alphabet, then anything formed concatenating the symbols
of `A` is a 'string' in `A`. By a grammar of the language L, we mean a device of
some sort that produces all of the strings that are sentences of L and only
these.

Note: Since sentences of natural languages (1) consist of a finite set of
phonemes and (2) are constructed from a finite set of phonemes (i.e. the
alphabet), natural languages fit this definition. Similarly, formal mathematics
is also a language.

.. sectnum::

Vocal-auditory Channel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ transmits signals over a channel.

Example: gibbon calls (vocal-auditory)
Example: paralinguistic phenomena (vocal-auditory)
Example: bee-dancing (optic)
Example: stickleback courtship (optic)
Example: instrumental music (auditory, but not vocal)
Example: gesture (optic)

Advantage: Vocal-auditory communication leaves the rest of the body free for activities that can be carried on at the same time.[1]

Broadcast transmission and directional reception
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has broadcast transmission if signs can be received in all directions.

A `communication system`_ has direction reception if receivers can localize the source through the message.

Example: bee-dancing
Example: stickleback courtship
Example: gibbon calls
Example: paralinguistic phenomena
Example: instrumental music

Note: Consequence of (01). (Stems from physics of sound)

Rapid fading (Transitoriness)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has rapid fading if signs fade after sending.

Example: gibbon calls
Example: paralinguistic phenomena
Example: instrumental music

Not all systems possess rapid fading:

Example: Animal tracks and spoors
Example: Written records

Note: Consequence of (01). (Stems from physics of sound)

Interchangeability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has interchangeability if a receiver can reproduce any message it receives.

Example: gibbon calls
Example: paralinguistic phenomena

Not all systems possess interchangeability:

Example: Courtship motions of stickleback are different, and neither can act out those appropriate to the other
Example: An infant cannot reproduce the message of its mother
Example: stickleback courtship

Total feedback
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has total feedback if a sender receives and comprehends messages it sends.

Example: gibbon calls
Example: paralinguistic phenomena
Example: instrumental music
Example: I hear myself say "the dog" when I say so

Not all systems possess total feedback:

Example: stickleback courtship (The male stickleback does not see the color of his own eye and belly that are crucial in stimulating the female)

Importance: Enables the so-called internalization of communicative behavior that constitutes a major position of thinking.

Specialization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has specialization if speech serve no purpose except communication.

Example: gibbon calls
Example: paralinguistic phenomena
Example: instrumental music
Example: A dog, panting with his tongue hanging out, is performing a biologically essential activity, since this is how dogs cool themselves off and maintain the proper body temperate. The panting incidentally produces sound, thereby may inform other dogs as to where he is and how he feels. But this transmission of information is strictly a side effect.
Example: Echolocation is not specialization

Semanticity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has semanticity if signals have meaning.

Example: bee-dancing
Example: gibbon calls
Example: paralinguistic phenomena
Example: The English word "salt" means salt, not sugar or pepper.
Example: Calls of gibbons possess semanticity; the gibbon has a danger call and it does not in principle matter that the meaning of the call is a great deal broader and more language than, say, the cry of "Fire!"

Not every `communication system`_ has semanticity:

Example: An overheated dog will pant to dissipate heat, and an observer may understand the panting to mean the dog is hot, but panting does not stand for overheated-ness the same way "overheated" does.
Example: stickleback courtship
Example: instrumental music

Arbitrariness
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has arbitrariness if signs have no indexical meaning.

Example: gibbon calls
Example: paralinguistic phenomena
Example: The word "salt" is not salty or granular
Example: "dog" is not "canine"
Example: "whale" is a small word for a large object
Example: "microorganism" is a large word for a small object

Not all communication is arbitrary:

Example: A picture looks like what it is a picture of.
Example: bee-dancing (A bee dances faster if the source of nectar she is reporting is closer and slower if it is farther away.)

Advantage: Does not restrict what can be communicated
Disadvantage: Is arbitrary

Note: Consequence of (07).

Discreteness
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has discreteness if each elementary signaling unit is discrete.

Example: gibbon calls
Example: If a speaker produces a syllable that deviates from the normal pronunciation of "pin" in the direction of "bin", he is not producing a third word, but just "pin" or "bin" in a noisy way. The receiver compensates if he can or else fails to understand.

Not all communication is discrete:

Example: paralinguistic phenomena (volume: a speaker may raise his voice along a continuous scale to indicate degree of anger or lower his voice along a continuous scale to indicate degree of confidentiality)
Example: bee-dancing

Displacement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has displacement if participants can communicate about
things independent from space or time.

Example: bee-dancing

Not every communicative system has displacement:

Example: gibbon calls
Example: Vervet monkeys can signal the presence of a predatory eagle, but cannot refer to the eagle that attacks a week ago; their communication is limited to what is immediately present.

Productivity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has productivity if users can produce and comprehend
messages that have never been sent or received.

Note: Productivity implies a system can generate an infinite number of signs.
Note: If a system has recursivity, then it has productivity.
Note: Productivity is possible if users can arrange symbols in novel ways to produce meaning.

Note: Productivity is not disproved by being unable to produce a particular message

Example: paralinguistic phenomena
Example: bee-dancing
Example: instrumental music
Example: Pictures do not have displacement, but are productive

Not every communicative systems has productivity:

Example: gibbon calls (finite set)
Example: stickleback courtship
Example: Alarm calls of Vervet monkeys 

A non-productive system may be called a "closed" system.
A productive system may be called an "open" system.

Whatever can be meant can be said.[1] A given language may not have the vocabulary or syntax to say what I mean in that language, but there are no barriers in principle to supplementing the impoverished language or saying what I mean in a richer one.[1]

Traditional transmission
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has traditional transmission if users must learn it
(and teach it).

Not every communicative system has traditional transmission:

Example: paralinguistic phenomena
Example: gibbons calls (globally uniform, so genetics must be responsible)
Example: instrumental music
Example: bee-dancing
Example: stickleback courtship

Duality of patterning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `communication system`_ has traditional transmission if signs are made of and
distinguished by meaningless parts, which can be combined in infinite
permutations to make novel signs.

Example: "tack", "cat", and "cat" have distinct meaning but are composed of the same three meaningless sounds in different permutations
Example: Morse code

Note: Consequence of (07).

Note: Duality of patterning is probably the last property to be developed, because it is unnecessary until distinct element run out.

Not every communicative systems has traditional transmission:

Example: bee-dancing
Example: paralinguistic phenomena
Example: gibbon calls

# Refutation

Language is only one of the symbol systems humans use to communicate.

Example: A wedding ring signs marital status [4]
Example: A "thumbs-up" gesture signals success, approval, or hope [4]
Example: A facial grimace may signal disapproval [4]

# Innate knowledge

Fact: Eventually, all normal human children are able to speak his or her local language.

How do children acquire mental grammar?

Claim: Parent teach grammar to their children.
Refutation:

- Not parents. Parents teach words to their kids, but language learning is not entirely the result of teaching words. (e.g. "from")
- Not school. Many non-literate societies. Certain grammatical patterns are taught (e.g. preposition can't end a sentence) but it's violated all the time. (That rule is based on notions of Latin and Greek.) Further, may apparent rules are _not_ taught. (e.g "manu-goddam-facturer" uses a rule that specifies where words can be injected)

Since adults are not consciously aware of the principles of mental grammar, they certainly cannot explain them to children- the most they can do is supply examples of patterns (in the form of grammatical sentences) or corrections to ungrammatical sentences (which do not explain rules, but provide correct form). This means children must figure out the patterns of the language.

How does a child construct his or her mental grammar?

Children are probably no more conscious of the patterns than adults. For one, they don't formally learn grammar until after they have learned how to speak.

Where does that leave the learning of language?

Conclusion: We can acquired unconscious patterns unconsciously, with little or no deliberate training. (Arguably, "learning" might not be the right word.) We might draw a parallel to learning how to skip or ride a bike.

### The argument for innate knowledge: The way children learn to talk implies that the human brain contains a genetically determined specialization for language

Jackendoff describes the inability of highly trained linguists to duplicate the feat of a unconsciously aided child the Paradox of Language Acquisition. (Neither have computer scientists.)

There are three steps involved in escaping the Paradox:

1.  What the child ends up with is a mental grammar that is completely inaccessible to consciousness. Hence adult linguists can't figure out the principle to mental grammar by just looking into their minds.
2. A substantial part of the language-learning process is also unconscious, so linguists can neither directly observe it nor ask children about it.
3. To overcome this difficult, we suppose that children have a head start on linguistics: children's unconscious strategies for language learning include some substantial hints about how a mental grammar ought to be constructed.

Perhaps language acquisition is like reproduction; people figure to how to reproduce, but it takes centuries to understand the mechanism.

More technically, the claim is that all of us as children come to the task of language learning equipped with a body of innate knowledge pertaining to language. Using this knowledge, children can find patterns in the stream of language being beamed at the them from the environment, and can use these patterns as a mental grammar. Because this innate knowledge must be sufficient to construct a mental grammar for any of the languages of the world, linguists call it Universal Grammar or UG.

This leads to three important questions for research:

1. What do children know (unconsciously) about language in advance of language learning? What is Universal Grammar?
2. How do they use Universal Grammar to construct a mental grammar?
3. How do they acquire Universal Grammar?

We focus on now on (3): How could there be such as thing as innate knowledge (knowledge that is not learned)?

- We have to remember that UG is as unconscious and inaccesible to introsepction as the final mental grammar we use.
- "Innate" is also used loosely, as it's not clear its present immediately at birth. It could develop afterward.
- Development of UG seems to follow a biological timetable. Children being acquiring grammatical patterns sometime toward their second birthday.
- UG is not learned; UG makes learning possible.

(3) amounts to: How can knowledge or cognitive organization be available to a child before learning? How could there be such a thing as innate knowledge?

The outlines of a mechanism behind innate knowledge are available. Two components are involved:

1. The determination of brain structure by genetic information
2. The determination of mental functioning by brain structure

1: Although there is plasticity in the brain's physical organization, there is good reason to believe that substantial aspects of this organization are genetic. Why should we suppose that our brains acquire their fundamental structure through learning rather than genetic inheritance?
2: The way we think is partly constrained by the way our brains are built. UG might be rephrased as saying that children have a certain "way of thinking" that enables them to construct a mental grammar, given appropriate inputs in the surroundings. The hypothesis is that this "way of thinking" is a consequence of the physical organization of the brain which is determined by genetic structure. The mechanism for acquiring innate knowledge is genetic transmission, through the medium of brain structure.

We can call this hypothesis the Genetic Hypothesis. It leads to range of issues.

It says the ability to learn language is rooted in our biology, a genetic characteristic of the human species, like opposable thumbs and a pelvis adapted for upright stance.

It hardly seems outlandish to think there might be such a specialized organ for language given the specialization of observable structures in animals - a bat's sonar, an elephant's trunk.

According to the Genetic Hypothesis, innate knowledge is determined by brain structure, so it is present only when the supporting brain structures are present. Development of the physical structure is not complete at birth. The physical growth of various parts of the body follows a fairly predictable timetable (e.g baby teeth, puberty).

- Need concept of innate knowledge to solve the Paradox of Language Acquisition

  - that children can unconsciously learn a mental grammar on their own, while
    linguists as a community can't figure out how the mental grammar works.
    Innate knowledge would give children a head start

- Why does Paradox of Language Acquisition arise? Because children don't learn
  language by being taught, rather they must figure out a MG that gives them the
  patterns for forming sentences. How do we know children must be figuring out a
  MG? Because that's what they have to end up with as adults in order to account
  for their ability to speak and understand an unlimited range of sentences.

### Questions about innate knowledge

The hypothesis of a genetically determined Universal Grammar has provoked various degrees of disbelief since it was proposed by Chomsky.

TODO: Come back to this

### Conclusions

Mental Grammar = Innate Part (Universal Grammar) + Learned Part

We leave it as an empirical question to determine how the mental grammar is parceled out between innate and learned parts.

Three basic criteria are involved:

1. If the language in question is different from other languages in some respect, the child must be able to acquire this difference, so it must fall into the learned part.
2. If certain aspects of all languages we have examined are alike, these aspects are _likely_ to fall into the innate part. Of course, there is always the possibility that they are alike purely by accident. In practice, this can be checked out by examining more languages, preferably unrelated ones.
3. Poverty of the stimulus: Suppose there is some aspect of language that children couldn't possibly figure out from the evidence in the speech they hear around them. Then this aspect can't be learned; it has to fall under the innate part of the language.

(3) inspires debate on what sorts of evidence children are capable of using.

Innate part of language = Part due to special purpose endowment for learning + Part due to general properties of the mind

We should try to minimize the part due to special purpose endowment for
learning. Such an endowment demands an evolutionary jump since the time we
diverged from the apes, and we would like to think that the jump was not too
extraordinary. (It must be though, to account for the Paradox of Language
Acquisiton.)

Recall our initial question: What does human nature have to be like in order for
us to be able to use language? Two more answers, having to do with the nature of
learning, have emerged from the Argument for Innate Knowledge.

1. The learning of language isn't just a passive "soaking up" of information
   from the environment. Language learners actively construct unconscious
   principles that permit them to make sense of information coming from the
   environment. These principles make it possible not just to reproduce the
   input parrotlike, but to use language in novel ways. What is learned comes as
   much from inside the learner as from the environment.
