Expression
================================================================================

An expression is a signifying linguistic unit. For example, the word "dog" is
an expression because it signifies the idea, ``DOG``, the sentence the "All men
are mortal" is an expression because it expresses the proposition `(forall (x)
(man x) => (mortal x))`. However, "1 / 0" is not an expression because it has no
definition, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is also not an expression
because it does not express an idea (nonsense), "Stop!" is not an expression
because it lacks propositional value, and "Walks the store the man" is not an
expression because it is grammatically invalid.

An expression is a combination of data and operators that can be evaluated to
produce a value.

Meaning
================================================================================

Assuming a principle of semantic compositionality, the meaning of an expression
is determined by the meanings of:

1. Its constituents
2. Its syntactic structure.

Analysis
================================================================================

An expression consists of:

1. Atoms
2. Expressions

An interpretation of an expression produces a value, which is determined in a
systematic way the values it gives to the component expressions.

# Classification

## Simple & Complex

A simple expression is an expression that is composed of an atom.

Example: "4"
Example: "True"

A complex expression is an expression that is not atomic.

Example: "2 + 2"
Example: "not False"


Morpho-syntactic Hierarchy
==========================

1. Morpheme
2. Word
3. Phrase
4. Phase
5. Sentence (clause)
6. Text
