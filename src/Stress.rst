Stress
================================================================================

Stress is a person's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition or a stimulus.

Note: A stressor is a stimulus that causes a person to perceive threat.

Stress is a body's way to react to a challenge.

    Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman suggested in 1984 that stress can be
    thought of as resulting from an "imbalance between demands and resources"
    or as occurring when "pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope".
    Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not
    a direct response to a stressor but rather one's resources and ability to
    cope mediate the stress response and are amenable to change, thus allowing
    stress to be controllable.

## Anxiety

Anxiety is an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous
behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints and rumination. It
is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over something unlikely to
happen, such as the feeling of imminent death. Anxiety is not the same as fear,
which is felt about something realistically intimidating.

Note: Anxiety is the opposite of flow.

## Depression

## Rumination

Rumination is defined as the compulsively focused attention on the symptoms of
one's distress, and on its possible causes and consequences, as opposed to its
solutions. Rumination is similar to worry except rumination focuses on bad
feelings and experiences from the past, whereas worry is concerned with
potential bad events in the future.

# Stress Management

To avoid diminished health, stress must be managed.

### Coping

Coping is expending conscious effort to reduce stress. Unconscious effort (e.g.
defense mechanisms) do not count. Coping can be maladaptive if it increases
stress. Coping generally refers to reactive coping, which follows the stressor,
and constrats with proactive coping, which aims to head off a future stressor.

Neurosis is a class of functional mental disorders involving distress but
neither delusions nor hallucinations, whereby behavior is not outside socially
acceptable norms.[1] It is also known as psychoneurosis or neurotic disorder,
and thus those suffering from it are said to be neurotic. The term essentially
describes an "invisible injury" and the resulting condition.
