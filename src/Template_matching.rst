Template matching
================================================================================

Template matching is a form of holistic recognition in which the units of
analysis are the same size as the patterns to be recognized. [Massaro1998]_

Template matching has some limitations:

- Template matching has no way to evaluate importance of matches.

- Simple template matching has no way to evaluate the importance of mismatches.

The problems with template matching become unwieldy when there many patterns to
be recognized because patterns tend to be similar to one another and the number
of template comparisons becomes very large.
