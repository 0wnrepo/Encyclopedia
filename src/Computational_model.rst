Computational model
================================================================================

A computational model is the definition of a set of allowable operations in
computation and their respective cost. A computational model is not necessarily
a computer model, but might consist of a set of operations that are described in
quantitative form. [1]_

Some examples of models include Turing machines and finite state machines.

Computational usually refers to systems that perform specific operations or
computations, such as computers.


The value of a computational model is that it can make precise predictions that
can be compared with human performance.
