Selling
================================================================================

Selling is the process of persuading a candidate to accept an offer (and stay).

The emphasis of selling should be placed on making a place where good developers
want to work (rather than convincing them it is).

There are two kinds of factors:

- Motivating factors, which if present, create satisfaction

- Hygiene factors, which if absent, create dissatisfaction

Hence the advice "don't take your highest paying offer".[1]

Presumably, satisfaction is inversely correlated with turnover.

Motivating factors include:

- Social opportunities
- Independence and autonomy (managers are not supervisors, developers are experts)
- Choice of project
- Meaningful work
- Opportunities to learn (depth/breadth)  (e.g. get to use new technologies, free technical books)
- Useful experience (e.g industry practice)
- Recognition: Getting to show off work (e.g. using open source software, no secrets) [4]
- Perks (e.g laundry service, free meals, gym)
- Signing bonus

Hygiene factors include:

- Adequate salary [4]
- Good tools and infrastructure (e.g. Python, not Java) [4]
- Control over tools (i.e. open-source, not proprietary) [4]
- Private offices (space to think, avoid distraction) [3],[4]
- Interesting work, novel technical challenges, no inessential problems [4]
- Good colleagues (smart, passionate, similar age, in essence, people that someone would want to meet and work with)
- Exciting company and product
- No (dysfunctional) politics [3]
- Relocation costs [3]
- Immigration issues [3]
- Location
- First-class treatment (profit center?) [4]
- Well-kept office
- High-quality workspace (e.g. Aeron Chairs, large monitors) [4]
- Short commute time
- Flexible working hours
- Fair performance review
- Fair organizational structure
- Internal transparency

# Deciding What's Valuable

Given multiple offers between different kinds of companies, deciding on which one to join can be difficult. Below are some things to consider.

Generally, unless you are extremely passionate about a particular field, it is useful to take the internship that will maximize how much one learns, both technically and culturally.

# Small startups (<50 people)

Small startups often have to ship fast and trade code quality to achieve their goals

People who are attracted to small startups tend to be the "hacker" type-- they get things done by any means possible, are pragmatic, and are more interested in product than computer science.

# Large 

Large companies necessarily enforce higher code standards:
    - Code must be readable by a large team of developers
    - Errors could be catastrophic for a business' reputation

## Startups

As a startup employee, you can increase your value at small startups by demonstrating you are able to scale with the company. This is doubly important if you are looking to become an entrepreneur.

## Corporate


# Negotiation

Note on how to go about negotiating an offer. Consult the offer document to get a sense of what to expect. This is extremely general and should be tailored to each specific company.

        - Skills in demand

### Intern Strategy

The goal of an internship should be to learn what kind of work or industry you want to be in once you graduate. [1]

- What thesis about myself/place I'd want to work am I testing with this internship? How well will this particular company help me test that thesis?
- Is there a chance I'd want to work here full-time, and would an internship help with that?
    - _It doesn't at Google for example - they make you do the full interview process anyway, and there are cases where people with A+ internship endorsements get passed over._
- Do I need to look more "legit" on my resume? Does this internship help with that?
    - Even if you don't want to work at Facebook/Google full-time, interning there can help establish credibility.


#### Choosing between startups [2]

You want to work for startups that are going to be successful. Obviously though, it's hard to pick winners.

Considerations:

- Has the founder has a successful venture in the past?
    - Past performance is a good indicator of future sucess
- Is the founder technical?
- Does the company or its employees have a track record of being good mentors?
- Is the company pre or post product-market fit?
- Is this a "well known" start up?


#### Choosing between larger companies [2]

- Ask about reputation
- Does the company have an official internship program?
    - Does it sound awesome?
- glassdoor.com
- Ensure it is a tech company
- Are they still innovative?
    - Look at the CEO
- Newer companies tend to have less management cruft
    - Exceptions exist though

## Company Dossier

- BATNA: Hire someone else
- Reservation price: ???
- Source of power
    - Skills are not unique
    - Little time left
    - Inability to get hired elsewhere
        - Little time left
        - Skills in limited demand

Recruiters should try to identify candidate job acceptance critera and dealbreakers to personalize selling.

Recruiters should be aware of what competitors are doing and how the company is doing things differently.
