Interpretation
================================================================================

Interpretation is the assignment of meaning to symbols_ of a language_.

Interpretation takes a context and a statement and evaluates them to produce
meaning.

The study of interpretation is hermeneutics.

An interpreter is a machine that carries out processes described in a
`programming language`_. [1]_

Different sorts of expressions make different sorts of contribution to the
containing expression. For example, "giraffes" and "periscopes" mean things of
certain types, "use" means a relation between agents and instruments, and "not"
is a negation operator

Principle of Compositionality
================================================================================

The principle of compositionality is the principle that meaning of a complex
expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the
rule used to combine them.

The principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the
lexical parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of
composition.

For example, "Socrates was a man" -> "S was a M"

The principle of compositionality is frequently taken to mean that every
operation of the syntax should be associated with an operation of the semantic
that acts of the meaning of its constituent combined by the syntactic operation.

## History

The idea appears among Indian philosopher of grammar such as Yaska.

The idea appears in Plato's work, such as in Theatetus.

The principle is also called Frege's Principle because Gottlob Frege is widely
credit for the first modern formulation of it.
