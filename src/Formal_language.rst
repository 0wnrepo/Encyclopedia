Formal Language
================================================================================

A formal language is a set of strings that may be constrained by rules that are
specific to it.

The field of formal language theory primarily studies the purely syntactical
aspects of such languages. (The study of interpretations of formal languages is
called formal semantics.)

Analysis
================================================================================

The alphabet of a formal language is the set of symbols from which the strings
of the language may be formed.

A string is a sequence of symbols.

A word is a string formed from an alphabet.
