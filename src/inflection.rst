Declension

Conjugation
===========

Conjugation is inflection of verbs.

The process of inflecting a verb is known as "conjugating" it.

Agreement (Concord)
===================

Agreement is a kind of inflection that depends on other grammatical unit to which it relates.

Example: "I am" demonstrates agreement.
Example: "I is" does not demonstrate agreement.

Structural features also explain subject-verb number agreement.

Agreement is done routinely and with surprising accuracy.

Consider what is involved in agreement:

1.Speakers must understand what constitutes a subject. It's not just the first word or phrase in a sentence since it can be moved around.
2. Speakers must determine what the verb is and which part of the verb carries number.
3. Speakers must determine what the number of the verb should be. Traditionally, the number of the subject controls the number of the verb.

How do speakers decide on the number of the subject?

Typically, the main considerations are:

1. The numerosity of the referent (one or more thing)
2. The lexical-grammatical number of the subject noun (singular or plural)
3. The presence in an utterance of plural nouns that are no the subject
