Coffee "beans" are actually seeds of the coffee plant.

Many kinds of coffee plants exist, which produce different beans. The most
popular are Arabica and Robusta.

Arabica is acidic and consists of 1% caffeine. 75% of worldwide production is
of Arabica beans.

Robusta is bitter and consists of 2% caffeine. 20% of worldwide production is of
Robusta. It is more disease and pest resistant (partly because of the extra
caffeine) and is therefore much cheaper. Robusta typically appears in canned
coffee that one finds in a supermarket.

Gourmet beans account for the remaining 5% of worldwide production.


Processing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Processing is the process of extracting the seeds of coffee beans from the
berries.

   A coffee bean mill.

There are three method of processing:

1. Dry Processed
2. Wet Processed
3. Pulped Natural

In dry processing, coffee beans are dried in the sun and then the cherry is
taken off. This results in a fruiter taste and heavy body. It also produces more
crema in espresso.

In wet processing, the coffee cherry is stripped off gently by water.

In pulped natural processing, the pulp is partially taken off then left to dry
then taken off. This result in characteristics of both above.

Roasting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roasting involves taking green coffee beans and roasting them for 8 to 15
minutes between 180C and 240C for 8 to 15 minutes.

Unroasted coffee beans contain similar acids, protein, and caffeine as those
that have been roasted, but lack the taste. Heat must be applied for other
chemical reaction to occur.

Lighter roasts are used to preserve original profiles

Once roasted, coffee is susceptible to lose flavor from moisture, light, and
oxygen. Therefore, roasting should take place as close to consumption as
possible. Sealed container may be used to protected coffee beans from air and
moisture and light.

   :height: 240 px

The roasting process removes, moisture, converts starches into sugar, breaks
down proteins, and precipitates the release of caffeol (coffee oil) which the is
essence of flavor.

As moisture is lost, the beans "pop" audibly (similar to popcorn).

Dark roasted beans are noticeably darker, oilier, shinier, and lighter (due to
moisture loss) than light roasted beans.

Caffeine diminishes with roast levels.

Roasting usually occurs either in a hot air roaster, which uses convection to
roast beans, or in commercial drum roasters.

Beans are usually roasted according to a roast profile-- a description of
temperature over time.

Degree (lightest do darkest):

- Light
    - Cinnamon (Toasted grain flavor, acidic, almost like tea)
    - New England (Acidic, not as bready. Popular in Northeastern US.)
- Medium
    - American (Popular in Eastern US)
    - City (Popular in rest of US)
    - Full City (Bittersweet.)
- Full Roast
    - Shiny
    - Vienna Roast (Bittersweet, caramely, little acidity. Occasionally used for espresso.)
- Double Roast
    - French Roast (Burnt undertones, little acidity.)
    - Italian Roast(Burnt tones, little acidity.)
    - Spanish Roast (Charcoal, tar tones)

Lighter roasts are more fruity and retain the influences from sourcing better
than dark roasts.

Preparation
================================================================================

Grinding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee is ground before brewing because...

   A blade grinder.

.. figure:: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Mlynek.jpg
   :height: 240 px

   A manual burr grinder.

There are two main kinds of grinders: burr grinders and blade grinders. Burr
grinders grind relatively uniformly. They may either be a wheel burr or a
conical burr. Wheel burrs are noisy and messy. Conical burrs have a cone like
edges on rings that produce more consist grind, and more expensive, and are used
for grinding espresso shots. Grinder may be either electric or manual. An 80
dollar manual grinder will grind more consistently than anything until the 200+
mark of electric burr grinder.

Brewing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brewing is the process of making coffee via combining ground coffee and hot
water. The goal of brewing is to extract as much of the good stuff (caffeol) and
as little of the bad stuff (tannins).

A kettle is useful for preparing boiling water. They make be electronic or
stove-top.

Extraction is affected by four variables:

1. Temperature

2. Grind size
   
3. Time

4. Procedure


Overextraction leads to excessive bitterness

The basis of good coffee is even extraction.

The compounds in coffee extract at different rates.

Coffee should be brewed with soft or hard water (rather than distilled water) to
reduce bitterness.

- Yield - How much of the soluble stuff was extracted from the beans?
- Strength - How much of the final brew if coffee and how much is water?
    - Usually about 1.15-1.5% depending on preferences
- Ration - Grams per liter. Generally you want 60g/L.

Brewing Methods

   Coffee being poured from a copper cezve (or ibrik). The long handle is used
   to avoid burning one's hands.

Coffee is ground to finest possible powder, then immersed in hot but not boiling
water. The coffee is brought to a boil three times before being poured (this
causes more delicate flavors to be lost) with the goal of maximizing foam.


Traditionally, the coffee is drank at extremely hot temperatures and served with
glass of cold water to fresh mouth to better taste coffee.

    - Served with Turkish delight
    - Sometimes pistachio grains are added to drink

Not all coffee is drunk: sludgey layer is left behind.

Percolator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Perkulator2.jpg/360px-Perkulator2.jpg
   :height: 240 px

A percolator is ...

Invented by British scientist and solider Count Rumford, otherwise known as Sir
Benjamin Thompson (1753-1814) following his pioneering work with the Barvarian
army.

Name stems from "percolate" which means "to cause a solvent to pass through a
permeable substance for extracting a soluble constitution". In the case of
coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee
grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give
coffee its color, taste, aroma, and stimulating properties.

Coffee percolators were once very popular but were replaced by drip methods in
the 1970s.

Percolators often expose grounds to higher temperates than other brewing
methods. As a result, coffee brewed with a percolator is susceptible to
over-extraction.

Percolators will often remove some of the volatile compounds in teh beans,
resulting in a pleasant aroma before brewing but a less flavorful cup.

Siphon pot

French press
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Frenchpress-wiki.jpg/240px-Frenchpress-wiki.jpg

A French press (also called a plunger, press pot, coffee press, or cafetiere) is
a coffee brewing device, invented in 1929 by Attilio Ca Calimani, a French man
living in Italy.

The French press works by placing coarsely ground coffee in a pot with hot
water, stirring them, then steeping for 3-5 minutes. Finally, the user plunges
the mixture to separate the coffee grounds from the drink.

French presses can also be used to brew loose tea.

Good French press models are made by `Bodum` and `Frieling`.

Aeropress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AeroPress is a relatively new method of brewing. Invented in 2005, the
AeroPress has roughly the same strength as espresso, is easy to clean and use,
and cheap.

- Just put near boiling water on beans on top of filter
- Attempt to automate pour over
- Need to heat water up greater than 190F

> Traditional drip brewing passes water through a bed of grounds. When the water
first drips into the bed, it is too hot and bitterness is extracted. As the
water filters downward through the bed, it becomes too cool and extraction is
weak. The water doesn't contact all of the grounds uniformly. Grounds at the
edge of the bed are under-extracted, while grounds at the center are over-
extracted and contribute bitterness.

Pod brewers, like Keurig, are a relatively new method that emphasize convenience
over taste and cost.

Espresso

A moka pot is a stove-top espresso maker which makes espresso by way of steam.
Compared to other ways of brewing espresso, moka pots are simple and cheap. Moka
pots are common in Italy.

An espresso machine is a device that brews coffee by forcing pressurized water
near boiling through a puck of ground coffee and a filter in order to produce a
espresso. Several kinds of espresso machines exist, including lever machines,
semi-automatic machines, and super-automatic machines, which primarily differ on
ease of use and control.

Culture
================================================================================

History
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee was originally cultivated in Ethiopia in 850, where it spread to rest of
Arabia.

Coffee was first mention in writing around 900. The origin of the word "coffee"
comes from the Turkisk "kahveh" (Arabic word "qahwah"). (Of note, the Arabic
word for breakfast, "kahvalti", literally means "before coffee".) Drinking
developed in the Ottoman empire.

Coffee was first cultivated in Europe in 1616. By the 1650s, the British were
filtering and steeping coffee. France and rest of Europe quickly followed suit.

Coffee and milk have been part of European tradition since the 17th century.
There is no mention of milk in before 1600.

Coffee was first introduced to the Americas in 1723.

During the 18th century, coffee houses in London basically functioned as clubs.
They were called "Penny Universities", as anyone could enter for a penny and
receive a cup of coffee. As a consequence, people of all level of societies
would mix. Inside, various kind of news media were available and people called
"runners" would run from cafe to cafe announcing the latest news.

Each coffee houses tended to attract a certain crowd; political groups or
trademens of different kinds.

Women were generally not permitted to drink coffee.

By the 19th century, coffee was brewed in special devices in public cafes.

Espresso machines were introduced by Luigi Bezzera of Milan in 1901. They became
very popular in the 1950s, the same time espresso bars appeared.

Small cups appears in 1950s, and machines can heat milk

> Will's was indisputably the most famous coffee house of the century. It was
owned by William Urwin and situated in one of the most stylish parts of London
on Russell Street in Covent Garden. One of the reasons for the popularity of
this particular coffee house was its regular visits from John Dryden the English
poet and dramatist (Ellis 58). Dryden sat at a principal table when he went to
Will's and was rarely approached by younger gentleman who thought it a privilege
to get a pinch from his snuff-box.

Drinks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee may be served hot or cold. In traditional or formal settings, coffee is
usually served in coffee cups (4 fluid oz) with saucers_ and in casual settings,
coffee is usually served in mugs (12 fluid oz or 350mL).

A *cafe au lait* is a French drink, consisting of double strength dark roast
coffee and steamed milk in a 1:1 ratio, poured both at the same time.
Traditionally, *cafe au lait* is served in a large porcelain bowl.

Raw espresso is traditionally consumed throughout the day after morning and
served in a demitasse (French "half cup") (60-90ml or 2-3 fl oz), half the size
of a full coffee cup.

A *cappucino* is an Italian drink, consisting of espresso, steamed milk, and milk
foam in a 1:1:1 ratio. Its name is derived from Capuchin friars because of the
color of their habits. Cappucino should be served in small (5-7oz) cups and is
usually consumed as the first drink in the morning, often with a sweet pastry

A *caffe macchiato* ("stained coffee") is ... stained with milk.

A *latte macchiato* ("stained milk") is an Italian drink which consists of
espresso added to a large quantity of milk. The little spot of crema left on top
of the milk is called a "macchia". Macchiatos feature more foam than lattes.

A *caffe ristretto* is a highly concentrated espresso.

Additions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee is often served with cream and sugar.

Coffee may be flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, hazelnut, cinnamon (popular in
Mexico), cardamom, and pistachios.

Salt may be added to reduce bitterness.

Spirits may be added to coffee, for instance, Irish coffee is made by adding
whiskey.

Coffee is often served with light refreshments, such as biscotti_, croissants_,
scones_, or donuts.

Taste
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aroma is responsible for all flavor attributes other than mouthfeel. It
perceived by two different mechanisms: nasally and retronasally (which happens
when coffee is in the mouth or swallowed and the aroma drifts into nose).

The number of known aromatic compounds constantly increases. Today well over 800
are known.

Acidity cannot be detected. Acidity combats bitterness. Darker roasts are less
acidic, which is why they are also more bitter.

Bitterness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often mistaken with astringency.

Bitterness is correlated with extent of extraction and dependent on the roast,
the water temperature (hot water is less bitter), brew time, grind size (and
dusts), and brewing procedure.

Bitterness is also correlated with the number of total dissolved solids of a
coffee

- Cholorgenic Acids
    - Make up 7% of dry weight basis of Arabica
    - Tannic acid (should be sour?)
    - Quinic acid (should be sour?)
        - A degradation product of chlorogenic acids during roasting
        - Excessive quinic acid is associated with unfavorable sourness when roasted too dark or left on a heater plate.
        - Is present at twenty times its threshold value and is partly responsible for the perceived bitterness in coffee 
    - Necessitate a concentration of 0.4% at pH of 5 to be perceived as bitte


Caffeine will be more bitter if grinds end up in the coffee (as in a French
press) due to overextraction.

Caffeine is bitter and accounts for 10% of coffee's bitterness. Hence coffee
made from Robusta beans is more bitter, and decaffeinated coffee is less bitter.

A lighter roast is less bitter than a medium or dark roast despite having more
caffeine because it has less soluable solids, a higher acid content, and a
more potent aroma. Roast profiles are the most important factor in bitterness.

A coarser grind is less bitter than a finer grind because ...

Bitterness can be reduced by adding acids (e.g. citric acid), sucrose (sugar),
and sodium chloride (salt).


Decaffeination
================================================================================

The swiss water decaffeination method works in four stages. First, green coffee
beans are immersed in water or steam. Second, caffeine is extract from the
beans. Third, the beans are steam stripped to remove all solvent residues from
beans. Finally, the beans are dried back to normal moisture content.

The end result are beans that contain less than 0.1% caffeine (3mg per cup)
without affect flavor.

However, decaffeination is expensive. Thus, decaf tends to taste bad, because
lower quality beans are used to keep the price point the same as regular coffee.
