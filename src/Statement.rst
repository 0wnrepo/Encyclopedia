Statement
================================================================================

A statement is a sentence_ expresses a proposition_. For example, "Socrates is a
man" is a statement because it expresses `man(Socrates)`, but "Greenness
perambulates" is not, because though a declarative sentence, it is nonsense.

The same proposition can be represented by multiple sentences.

Example: "Is Socrates a man?" express `man(Socrates)` as a question.
Example: "Socrates es un hombre." express `man(Socrates)` in Spanish.
Example: "2 + 2" expresses the same thing as "2 * 2", which is 4

Sociolinguistic effect
================================================================================

Making a statement demonstrates confidence because it is less safe then asking a
question. A statement takes a position, and it introduces the possibility of
disagreement.

A derogatory statement is a disrespectful statement. Said playfully, a
derogatory is a tease, otherwise it is an insult.
