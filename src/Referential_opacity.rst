Opacity: "Mary believes that Cicero is a great orator" gives rise to an opaque
context; although Cicero was also called 'Tully', we can't simply substitute
'Tully' for 'Cicero' in this context ("Mary believes that Tully is a great
orator") and guarantee the same truth value, for Mary might not know that the
names 'Tully' and 'Cicero' refer to one and the same thing.
