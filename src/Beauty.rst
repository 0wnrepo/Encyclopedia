Beauty
================================================================================

Beauty is ...

    The kinds of things we love-persons and objects both-and our reasons for
    loving them and finding them beautiful determine and, express, a large part
    of our character. To find something beautiful, I have been saying, involves
    the sense that life will be more worthwhile if that beautiful object were to
    become part of it.

    But I have said nothing about what makes life worthwhile and unlike Plato,
    who thinks that this is in all cases moral virtue, I don't even think that
    there is anything both general and informative to say about it. - Alexander
    Nehamas
