Lemma
================================================================================

A lemma, or citation form, is a particular form of a lexeme_ that is chosen by
convention to represent a canonical form of a lexeme_. Said another way, a lemma
is basically the dictionary form or base form of a word, as opposed to the
various inflected forms of a word.  So jump, jumps, jumped, and jumping are all
words and all inflections of a single lemma, jump.  There is one lemma here,
even though these words can correspond to different parts of speech and
different word senses.

Note, a lemma, as a mere *canonical* word form, may have multiple senses_.
