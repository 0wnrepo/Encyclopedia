# Language Acquisition

Language acquisition is the process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend language.

Note: Language acquisition is a quintessential human trait; non-humans do not communicate via language.

# History

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Chomsky first laid out the basic parameters underlying a theory of language ability, which justifiably makes him the creator of modern linguistic theory.

# Research Methods

Research on language acquisition studies how children learn the lexicon and grammar of a language.

Because the process results in a fully functioning adult, child development covers all of psycholinguistics.

The analysis of systematic errors in speech, writing and typing of language as it is produced can provide evidence of the process which has generated it.

## Nature vs. Nurture

We use language as a vehicle to examine the way humans are for two reasons:

1. The possession of language has always been regarded as one of the major differences between men and beasts.
2. The modern study of language has uncovered complexities of the mind far beyond what anyone would have imagined thirty years ago. (That have wide-reaching implications.)

Human experience is affected by the fact that we can all speak an understand a language:

- We have access to history, accumulation of technology, legal systems.
- Language makes it possible to coordinate the actions of large numbers of people. Not just moving together, but complex plans, like theater.

Note: Language does not enable thought (though it may help sometimes).
Example: Musical composition is thought without language and animals probably think.

- What does human nature have to be like to account for the fact that we can all speak and understand a language? (Not the consequences, but the prerequisites.) What do we need in order to be able to talk?

Note: The human ability to speak is not related to brain size.
    Example: Whales and elephants have bigger brains.
    Example: Dolphins have bigger ratio of brain mass to body mass.
    Note: There is no logical reason it should be; Scaling is not the same as structural innovation.

We can lay these two parameters out as abbreviated "Fundamental Arguments":

1. The argument for mental grammar: The expressive variety of language implies that a language user's brain contains a set of unconscious grammatical principles.
2. The argument for innate knowledge: The way children learn to talk implies that the human brain contains a genetically determined specialization for language.
3. The argument for the construction of experience: Our experience of the world is actively constructed by the unconscious principles that operate in the brain.

From (1) and (2) we conclude:

- The ability to speak and understand a human language is a complex combination of nature and nurture.
- The part coming from nature is a specific human adaptation for language learning and use.

- What does it mean to learn a language? Covered this briefly. But mention, fluency. What is fluency really? How does one know if one is fluent?
