Compensation for coarticulation
================================================================================

An example of compensation for coarticulation is that if a speaker produces a
gesture with a front place of articulation, it may be pulled slightly backward
if it follows a back place of articulation and listeners' phonetic category
boundaries shift (compensate) accordingly. (Boundaries are distinguished by the
frequency distribution of acoustic energy.)
    
It is well known that listeners perceptually compensate for the |ci|_ of one
phoneme on the production of its neighbors and adjustment to such |ci| is
thought to be among the most essential tasks of the early stages of processing
in speech perception.
