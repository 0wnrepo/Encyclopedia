Direct realism
================================================================================

**Direct realism** is a theory of `perception`_ developed by `James Gibson` that
claims:

1. `Perception`_ allows us to have direct awareness of the world because it
   involves direct recovery of the `distal source` of the event that is perceived.

2. Events in the environment lawfully structure informational `media` (such as
   light and air) into the form of a lawfully structured informal array
   (optical, acoustic, haptic, etc), which is available to perceivers sensory
   systems, which have evolved to detect this information
