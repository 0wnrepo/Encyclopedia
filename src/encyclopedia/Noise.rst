Noise
================================================================================

Noise is anything added to a `signal`_ between its transmission and reception
that is not intended by the `source`_. [3]_

* Distortion of sound or crackling in a telephone wire
* Static in a radio signal
* "snow" on a television screen

Noise may affect any part of the process-- either affect the signal, the
message, or the intention.
