Grammar
================================================================================

A grammar is the set of structural rules that governs the composition of
`clauses`, `phrases` and `words` in any given `natural language`.

A grammar describes valid `sentences`.

The grammar of a language is the set of rules of a language that enable
speakers to put words together into sentences.

Grammar is unlike school grammar which is a social norm. So "incorrect"
grammar still is grammatical; it's just different.

Example: British English and American English.

.. note::

    The particular patterns of mental grammar may be different across languages, but patterns of comparable complexity can always be found.

The rules of grammar are unobservable and they must be studied indirectly.

.. note::

    That we can command language without being conscious of it is similar to the command of our bodies.

A grammar consist of:

1. `morphology`
2. `syntax`

# Morphological analysis

# Finite State Transducer (FST)

Finite state traducers map between one representation and another.

Sequential traducers are efficient 

# Stemming & Lemmatization

The goal of stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflection form and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form.

Example: {am, are, is} => be
Example: {car, cars, car's, cars'} => car
Example: "the boy's car are different color" => the boy car be differ color

## Stemming

Stemming is the process of reducing words to their stems.

- Crude heuristic process
- Chops off the ends of words
- Often include the removal of derivational affixes
- Most commonly collapses derivationally related words
-
Lemmatization:

- Does morphological analysis and return the dictionary form of a word
- Commonly only collapses the different inflectional forms of a lemma

# Natural Production

Slips of the tongue reveal that affixes can be produced separately from stems.

Example: "It's not only us who have screw looses" (for "screws loose")
Example: "Words of rule formation" for "rules of word formation"
Example: "easy enoughly" for "easily enough"

- Priming tests for verifying hypotheses

A word is recognized faster if it has been seen before recently

# Regular & Irregular

A regular word follows the rules of morphological transformation.

Example: (walk, walks, walking, walked, walked)

A irregular word does not follow the rules of morphological transformation.

Verbs:

Example: (eat, eats, eating, ate, eaten)
Example: (catch, catches, catching, caught, caught)
Example: (cut, cuts, cutting, cut, cut)

Noun:

Example: (mouse, mice)
Example: (goose, geese)
Example: (ox, oxen)
Example: (go, went)
Example: (fly, flew)
