Tachistoscope
================================================================================

A tachistoscope is a device that displays an image for a specific amount of
time. It can be used to increase recognition speed, to show something too fast
to be consciously recognized, or to test which parts of an image are memorable.
Tachistoscopes were used extensively in psychological research before computers
became ubiquitous.
