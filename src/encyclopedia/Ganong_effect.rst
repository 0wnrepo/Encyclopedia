Ganong Effect
================================================================================

Subjects are more likely to perceive ambiguous speech sounds in a lexical
context as consistent with the surrounding lexical.

For instance, if an ambiguous speech sound is exactly between ``/t/`` and
``/d/``, a hearer might normally have difficult deciding what it is. But if the
same sound is heard that the end of a word like ``woo/?/`` (where ``?`` is the
ambiguous sound) then the hear will likely perceive the sound as ``/d/``,
presumably because ``wood`` is a word but ``woot`` is not.
