Conceptualization
================================================================================

**Conceptualization** is the process of determining what to say.

The speaker conceives an intention and selects relevant information in
preparation for construction of intended utterance.

Conceptualization outputs a pre-verbal message.

## Intention

In theory, motives range across intentions to convert particular pieces of
information, desires to impress listeners with erudition or eloquence, aims to
articulate clearly and fluently, and everything in between. All of these are
relevant to understand LP.

## Messages

A message is a communicative intention.

Messages are pre-verbal => Language is separate from thought.

Example: Transient aphasia: the experience of being fully aware of the target
idea, yet being unable to find and saying the word ("speechlessness").

The properties of messages (as opposed to their contents) have begun to be
understood in research on referential communication.

## Message-making

How do speakers transform a message into a set of communicable meanings?

We can learn by comparing the ways in which speakers of different languages go
about forming messages.

One consequence of pre-verbal nature of messages is that speakers cannot tell in
advance when a message will give rise to linguistic ambiguity and so speakers do
not reliably disambiguate utterances.

For example, if there is a baseball bat and a animal bat in a room, many
speakers will talk about either by just calling it a "bat" failing to realize
that the listener sees two bats. This is not just due to egocentricity, since
speakers do avoid ambiguity when it had perceptual or conceptual basis. If there
are two baseball bats of different sizes, speakers will reliably use
discriminating adjectives to refer to them.

To frame messages that comprehensible to listeners, speakers may have to draw on
experiences that the listeners may need. In many cases though, speakers have to
work hard enough merely to transform messages into language that they do not
engage in perspective-taking required to reckon with what listeners do and do
not know.

* Concepts are different from abstract linguistic concepts (lemmas) and word
  forms.
