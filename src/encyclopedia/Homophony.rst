Homophony
================================================================================

Homophony is phonological ambiguity_; when two expressions have the same
phonological form but different senses_. For example:

* "to", "two", "too"

A homophone is a word that is pronounced the same as another word but differs in
meaning. The words may be spelled the same, such as "rose" (flower) and "rose"
(past tense of "rise"), or differently, such as "to", "two", and "too". The
words may different only in part of speech, such as "experiment" (the noun) and
"experiment" (verb).

Syllables are almost always ambiguous in isolation, meaning that they can be
interpreted as providing incomplete information abut the word the speaker is
intending to communicate.[1]
