Homophony
================================================================================

Homophony is phonological ambiguity_; when two expressions have the same
phonological form but different senses_. For example:

* "to", "two", "too"

Syllables are almost always ambiguous in isolation, meaning that they can be
interpreted as providing incomplete information abut the word the speaker is
intending to communicate.[1]
