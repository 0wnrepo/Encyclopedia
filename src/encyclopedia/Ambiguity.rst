Ambiguity
================================================================================

**Ambiguity** is any attribute of a concept whose meaning cannot be definitely
resolved according to a process consisting of a finite number of steps.

Ambiguity provides a puzzle for functionalist theories which attempt to explain
properties of linguistic systems in terms of communicative pressures.[1]

One might imagine in a perfect `communication system`_, `language`_ would
completely disambiguate meaning.[1] Each linguistic form would map bijectively
to a meaning and comprehenders would not need to expend effort inferring what
the speaker intended to convey.

The existence of ambiguity in language has been argued to show that the key
structures and properties of language have not evolved for purposes of
communication or use.[1]

Kinds
================================================================================

Ambiguity occurs at all levels of `linguistic analysis`. [1]_ That ambiguity
occurs on so many linguistic levels suggests a far-reaching principle is needed
to explain its origins and persistence.

Semantic ambiguity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Out of context, words have multiple `senses` and `syntactic categories`_. [1]_

Syntactic and semantic ambiguity are frequent enough to present a substantial
challenge to `natural language processing`_.[1]

Morphological ambiguity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Morphemes may be ambiguous out of context.[1]

* English '-s' denotes either a plural noun marking ("trees") a possessive
  ("Dylan's") or a present tense verb conjugation ("runs").

Phonological ambiguity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phonological forms are often mapped to multiple distinct word meanings.

  * "to", "two", "too"

Syllables are almost always ambiguous in isolation, meaning that they can be
interpreted as providing incomplete information abut the word the speaker is
intending to communicate.[1]

Benefits
================================================================================

Ambiguity gives two beneficial properties to `communication systems`_ that
possess it: [1]_

1. Where context is informative about meaning, unambiguous language is partly
   redundant with the context and therefore inefficient

2. Ambiguity allows the re-use of words and sounds which are more easily
   produced our understood

Hypothesis: Language approximates an optimal code for human communication.

@SEE: Zipf 1949

Zipf:
    - Ambiguity fits withing framework of his unifying "principle of least effort"
    - Ambiguity can be understood by considering competing desires of speaker and listener
        - Speaker can minimize effort with a perfectly ambiguous language (a single word)
        - Listeners can minimize effort with a perfectly unambiguous language
    - Natural language would strike a balance between two opposing forces arriving at a middle ground.
        - Unification
        - Diversification
    - Balance between these forces can be observed in the relationship between word frequencey and rank frequency
    - "Law of meaning distribution" argues that the number of meaning a word has should scale with the square root of its frequency

It is unlikely that a speaker's effort is minimized by a totally ambiguous
language, since confusion means that the speaker may need to expend effort
clarifying what was intened.

Zipf's basic intuition, that ambiguity result from a rational process of
communication, is fundamentally correct.[1]

Ambiguity can be understood by the trade-off between two communication
pressures which are inherent to any communicative system:[1]

1. Clarity

2. Ease (of use)

A clear communication system is one in which the intended meaning can be
recovered from the signal with high probability.[1]

An easy communication system is one which signals are efficiently produced,
communicated, and processed.[1]

Man factor determine ease for human language:

  * Words that are easy to process are likely short, frequent, and phonotactically well-formed

Clarity and ease are opposed because there are a limited number of "easy" signals which can be used; in order to assign meanings unambiguously or clearly, one must also use words which are more difficult.[1] 

  * NATO phonetic alphabet trades ease for clarity
  * Pronouns trade clarity of ease

Waslow 2005:

    - Ambiguity reduces memory demands of storing a lexicon, though human memory is probably not a bottle-neck for vocabulary size
    - May be processing constraint against longer morphemes
    - May be useful in language contact situations
    - Sometimes ambiguity serves a communicative function when speakers intend to be ambiguous
      * Nothing is better than you're cooking

- Waslow is unconvincing because ambiguity is so common[1] 

Ferrer Cancho and Lotero:
    - Ambiguity is a necessary precondition of combinatorial systems, since combingin multiple units has no advantage when each unambiguously communicates a full meaning
    - Ambiguity is predicated to airse in any morphosyntactic system
Juba 2011:
    - Ambiguity allows for more efficient compressions when speakers and listeners have boundely different prior distributions on meanings
