Inflection in language
================================================================================

Synthetic & Analytic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A language is analytic (or isolating) iff it has no degree of inflection.

Example: Mandarin Chinese

A language is synthetic iff it has some degree of inflection.

Example: Latin is strongly inflected.
Example: English is weakly inflected.

Note: Languages with weak inflection may rely on order.
Note: Programming languages rely on order, but there is no inherent need for that.

### Synthetic

A language is polysynthetic iff a sentence can consists of a single highly-inflected word.

Example: Many American Indian languages.

A language is agglutinative iff it uses agglutination extensively: most words are formed by joining morphemes together.

A language is fusional iff it has a tendency to overly many morphemes to denote grammatical change.

Example: Sanskrit
Example: Greek
Example: Latin

Fusionality is...

Example: Latin "bonus". "-us" denotes masculine gender, nominative case, and singular number.
