Phoneme
================================================================================

A phoneme is the smallest contrastive linguistic unit which may bring about a
change of meaning.

Two words which differ in meaning through a contrast of a single phoneme are
called `minimal pairs`.

Different languages_ share many of the same phonemes. A family of 50 or 60
phonemes is sufficient to describe all of the world's languages.

The phoneme was conceptualized as a fairly holistic unit (template) until some
linguists came up with the concept of *distinctive features*, which were
properties that distinguished among the different phonemes (e.g. voicing). It
turned out that only about a dozen distinctive features were necessary to
describe all the phonemes in a particular language.
