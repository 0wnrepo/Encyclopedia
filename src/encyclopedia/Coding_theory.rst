Coding theory
================================================================================

Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes and their fitness for a
specific application.

Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, and error correction.

Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines for the purpose of designing
efficient and reliable data transmission methods.

There are essentially two aspects to coding theory:

1. Data compression (or, source coding)

2. Error correction (or, channel coding)

Source coding attempt to compress the data from a source to transmit it more
efficiently.

Channel coding adds extra data bits to make the transmission of data more
robust to disturbances present on the transmission channel.
