Amphiboly
================================================================================

Amphiboly is syntactic ambiguity_.

For example, "I'm glad I'm a man, and so is Lola." can be parsed as "Lola and I
are both glad I'm a man", or "I'm glad Lola and I are both men", or "I'm glad
I'm a man, and Lola is also glad to be a man."
