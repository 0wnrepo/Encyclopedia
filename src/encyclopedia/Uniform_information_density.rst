Uniform Information Density
================================================================================

Our arguments are closely related to `Uniform Information Density` (UID) which
holds that speakers are more likely to choose words and structures which
maintain a roughly constant rate of information transmission, UID and closely
related theories have been used to explain phenomena such as discourse-level
predictability and reduction.

An ambiguous_ linguistic form conveys less information about its intended
meaning than unambiguous linguistic form. Therefore, to keep the entropy rate
constant, one might choose ambiguous linguistic units which are *less*
surprising in other way which match our findings: this strategy would result in
ambiguous words being more phonotactically predictable, higher-frequency (less
surprising), and shorter (to maintain constant information-per-ptime). However,
we argue that the results presented above are not merely a consequence of UID,
though they rely on similar ideas and theoretical basis. Most importantly, UID
does not directly predict that efficient language *should* be ambiguous_, since
there are other ways to construct a linguistic system with constant information
rate.
