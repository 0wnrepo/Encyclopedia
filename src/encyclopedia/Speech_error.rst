Speech Errors
================================================================================

A **speech error** or "slip of the tongue" is a deviation from the apparently
intended form of an `utterance`.

Note: A speech error may be intentional.

Every speaker of every language makes speech errors.

- For normal speakers of English, one or two errors occur on average about every
  thousand words.

- Analogous errors occur in sign languages and in writing and typing - basically
  all `media` in which language is produced.

Collection
================================================================================

Researchers collect speech errors in two ways:

1. Collect them from natural `speech`_.

   - Often researchers try to write down all slips of the tongue that they hear.
     This lead to a biased sample toward errors that are most noticeable. One
     can also study recordings but this takes a long time since slips are
     uncommon (1/1000).

2. Evoke them in controlled experiments.

   - The ability to test specific hypothesis, while controlling for extraneous
     factors, is an advantage of the experimental approach over natural error
     collection. Furthermore, they allows for accurate recordings. However, by
     altering the processes of speech production, its possible that artificial
     slips are not indicative of natural production. Hopefully, the conclusions
     from experimental and natural data agree, and largely it happens to be the
     case.

Classification
================================================================================

Speech errors are constrained rather than made randomly.

Speech errors obey a `syntactic category rule`. When one word erroneously
replaces another, most of the time the target and substituting word are of the
same syntactic category.

TODO: are constrained -> X constrains speech. Syntax?

3. Interference can come both from within the utterance and from outside the
   utterance.

A segment is a linguistic unit.

A speech error is classified according to:

- The nature of the disturbance

- The size of the affected segment

Note: Some slips are ambiguously classified.  Note: Error patterns are weak
support for any theory.

### Natures of Disturbance

- An addition is an error that adds linguistic material.  - An exchange is an
  error that causes two linguistic units to change place.  - An anticipation is
  an exchange that causes a later segment to replace of an earlier segment - A
  preservation is an exchange that causes an earlier segment to replace a later
  segment.

### Segment Errors

- Phrase:                  "I wanted to read my grandmother to the letter" -
  Word:                    "I wanted to read the envelope to my grandmother" -
  Inflectional morpheme:   "I wanted to readed the letter to my grandmother." -
  Stem Morpheme:           "I readed to want the letter to my grandmother" -
  Consonant Cluster:       "I wanted to read the gretter to my grandmother." -
  Phonological feature:    "I wanted to read the letter to my brandmother."

## Analysis

Despite ambiguities in categorization there seem to be some solid facts
regarding the size of the linguistic units that slips.

Some speech errors are more common than others. Particularly, word, phoneme, and
morpheme errors are the most vulnerable. Researcher suggest that most basic
units are the most vulnerable. 

# Evidence of Grammar

Evidence to the structural underpinning of everyday utterances comes from the
occurrence of speech errors

A mistake like "I got into this guy with a discussion" instead of "I got into a
discussion with this guy" illustrates several points about the structural
scaffolding behind words:

1. Something more than meaning guides word placement because the typical
   products of errors are nonsensical yet grammatical.  2. There are pattern in
   errors that disclose the mechanism of word arrangement. Words that are
   confused in errors are very like to represent the same form class (e.g. noun,
   preposition, adjective) as if the assembly process at some point selected
   words for structural rather than semantic suitability.

To the extent that a sentence is built rather than retrieved, you can get slips,
predominantly those involving the building blocks of representation.

Speech errors arise when there is some creativity in the `speech production`_
process - where the system actually builds rather than retrieves.
