Communication System
================================================================================

A **communication system** is a system_ in which communication_ takes place. A
`communication system`_ consists essentially of five parts: an information
source_, a transmitter, a channel_, a receiver_, and a destination.  [1]_

This includes animal communication systems and `human communication systems`_,
such as language_.

Properties
================================================================================

Also, communicative pressures?

A good `communication system`_ is one in which communication_ (from production
to comprehension) is optimally efficient. [2]_ This involves designing a code
which balances efficiency of sending, efficiency of receiving, and fault
tolerance.

Fault tolerance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fault tolerance refers to the ability for a message_ to be received as intended
over a noisy_ channel_.

The central idea is that the sender can encoding his message in a redundant way
by using an `error-correcting code` which allows the receiver to detect a
limited number of errors that may occur anywhere in the message, and often to
correct these errors without retransmission.

An example of a communication system designed to be fault-tolerant is the
`NATO phonetic alphabet`.

.. todo: ease of comprehension and ease of production are not independent

Clarity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clarity refers to ease of comprehension. In orthographic systems, clarity is
also known as "readability".

Conciseness
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conciseness refers to ease of production. The opposite of conciseness is
verbosity.

In systems where context_ is informative about meaning, conciseness may be
enhanced by re-using efficient signs_, provided comprehenders can efficiently
and reliably disambiguate ambiguous_ signs_. In `language use`_, context_
disambiguates ambiguous_ signs_ so well, that when it is used we often
consciously notice it as humorous. [2]_

Language users do not appear to go to great lengths to avoid linguistic
ambiguities, despite actively avoiding conceptual ambiguities_. `Ferreira,
Slevc, and Rogers (2005)` found that experimental participants chose to produce
descriptions of objects that avoided conceptual ambiguities, such as saying
"small bat" rather than just "bat" when a large bat was also present. However,
speakers much less often went to similar lengths to avoid purely linguistic
ambiguities (such as "baseball bat" when an animal bat was also present).

`Levinson (2000)` has argued explicitly that speaker articulation, not
hearer inference, is the principal bottleneck in human language. Inference is
"cognitively cheap": therefore, normal human communication requires the
comprehender to make continual inferences about speaker intention, and does
not require the speaker to fully articulate every shade of meaning.

Hypothesis: Language approximates an optimal code for human communication.

@SEE: Zipf 1949

Zipf:
    - Ambiguity fits withing framework of his unifying "principle of least effort"
    - Ambiguity can be understood by considering competing desires of speaker and listener
        - Speaker can minimize effort with a perfectly ambiguous language (a single word)
        - Listeners can minimize effort with a perfectly unambiguous language
    - Natural language would strike a balance between two opposing forces arriving at a middle ground.
        - Unification
        - Diversification
    - Balance between these forces can be observed in the relationship between word frequencey and rank frequency
    - "Law of meaning distribution" argues that the number of meaning a word has should scale with the square root of its frequency

Main factor determine ease for human language:

* Words that are easy to process are likely short, frequent, and phonotactically
  well-formed

Waslow 2005:

    - Ambiguity reduces memory demands of storing a lexicon, though human memory is probably not a bottle-neck for vocabulary size
    - May be processing constraint against longer morphemes
    - May be useful in language contact situations
    - Sometimes ambiguity serves a communicative function when speakers intend to be ambiguous
      * Nothing is better than you're cooking

- Waslow is unconvincing because ambiguity is so common[1] 

Ferrer Cancho and Lotero:
    - Ambiguity is a necessary precondition of combinatorial systems, since combingin multiple units has no advantage when each unambiguously communicates a full meaning
    - Ambiguity is predicated to airse in any morphosyntactic system
Juba 2011:
    - Ambiguity allows for more efficient compressions when speakers and listeners have boundely different prior distributions on meanings
