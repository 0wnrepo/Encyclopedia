Perception
=================================================================================

Perception is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory
information.

Perception is not the passive receipt of signals, but is shaped by learning,
memory, expectation, and attention.

Perception involves top-down processes and bottom-up processes of processing
sensory input. The bottom-up processes transform low-level information to
higher-level information (e.g. extra shapes for object recognition). The
top-down processing refers to a person's concept and expectations and selective
mechanisms that influence perception.

The `perceptual systems` of the brain enable individuals to see the world around
them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and
rapidly varying.

Process
=================================================================================

An example would be a person looking at a shoe. The shoe itself is the `distal
object`_. When light from the shoe enters a person's eye and stimulates their
retina, that stimulation is the `proximal stimulus`_. The image of the shoe
reconstructed by the brain of the person is the `percept`_.

Glossary
=================================================================================

.. _distal object:

Distal object
    An object in the real word that is the object of perception. (*distal*
    formed from 'distant' + 'al' on model of 'central', 'dorsal', 'ventral')

.. _transduction:

Transduction
    The process of sensory organs transforming input energy into neural
    activity.

.. _proximal stimulus:

Proximal stimulus
    The raw pattern of neural activity.

.. _percept:

Percept
    The resulting mental recreation of the distal object.

.. _sensory modality:

Sensory modality
    A kind of sensation, such as warmth, sound, or taste.
