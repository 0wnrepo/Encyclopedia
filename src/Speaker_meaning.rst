Speaker meaning
================================================================================

Speaker meaning (=utterer's meaning = nonconventional meaning) is
nonconventional nonnatural meaning.

* In uttering "Please sit down.", Paul meant that Jean was to sit down.[1]
* Many gestures

Formally we might say:

- "In doing `x`, a speaker `S` means for audience `A` that `p`.".[1]
- "`x` nonnaturally meant something (on a particular occasion)"
- "`x` nonnaturally meant that so-and-so (on a particular occasion)"

Speaker meaning is a type of intention.[1] This intention is special because it is reflexive and has linkage (it is an intention by one person that cannot be satisfied without the linked action of another).[1]

    * Paul cannot fulfill his intention toward Jean without her coordinated action is recognize that intention.[1]

The intentional aspect of speaker's meaning is special because:

1. Reflexivity. The statement refers back to itself.
2. Linkage. An intention by one person that cannot be satisfied without the linked action of another person.

    * Paul cannot fulfill his intention toward Jean without her coordination action in recognizing that intention.

Speaker meaning has two parts:[1]

1. Saying
2. Implicating

(1) What is said is what speakers mean mostly through the conversational content of the sentence they utter.[1]

    * In uttering "There's a garage around the corner", what is said is that there is a garage around the corner. The rest of what B meant is implicated.[1]

Some implicatures are conventional and therefore part of the sentence meaning.[1]
