Equivalence is...

There are two kind of equivalence:

1. Dynamic equivalence
2. Formal equivalence.

Dynamic equivalence or "sense for sense translation" translates the meaning of phrases or whole sentences.

Formal equivalence or "word-for-word" translation translates the meaning of individual words.

The two terms were coined by Eugene Nada as way to describe ways of translating the Bible.
