Affix
================================================================================

An affix is a bound morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word.

An affix is unit that adheres to stems to change their meanings and grammatical
functions.

An affix may be lexical or inflectional.

Kinds
================================================================================

There are four kinds of affixes.

A affix is a prefix iff it appears before a stem.

Example: "un-do"

A affix is a suffix iff it appears after a stem.

Example: "do-ing"

A affix is an infix iff it appears within a stem.

Example: "Minne-flippin-sota"

"bloody" works similarly in British English.

A affix is a circumfix iff it appears around a stem.

Example: "en-light-en"

Function
================================================================================

Some affixes are functions on syntactic categories, or derivational.

- "-y" :: (N -> Adj), grease -> greasy

- "-ness" :: (Adj -> N), pretty -> prettiness

- "--ize" :: (N | Adj -> V), human -> humanize

Other affixes are inflectional, e.g. cat -> cats. They do not change category.
