Introduction
===============================================================================

All around the world there are children who successfully learn two languages
simultaneously from birth.

The authors argue that the human mind is as prepared to acquire two first
languages as it is to acquire one.

Current theories of language acquisition are concerned primarily with explaining
monolingual acquisition or acquisition of a second language after the first is
established and fail to address simultaneous bilingualism. To understand the
particulars of bilingual acquisition and to provide the information necessary
for comprehensive, generalizable theories of language acquisition, research on
bilingual acquisition is essential.

Language discrimination
===============================================================================

It was once widely believed that bilingual children begin acquisition with a
default assumption that all language input is part of a single language and they
they only separate their languages after establishing an initial lexicon and
syntax.

Rhythm
------

One source of information available to bilingual infants for distinguishing
their two languages is the surface phonetic characteristic that differ among
languages.

Languages may be divided into `rhythmical classes`_. Newborn infants can
discriminate languages from different `rhythmical classes`_ but cannot
discriminate languages from the same `rhythmical class`_, though sensitivity to
differences in the latter improves rapidly. [#]_ This has led to the suggestion
that discrimination of two languages from within the same `rhythmical class`_
relies on knowledge of one language and the resulting ability to notice another
language as 'different', but experiments have shown this distinction is not
essential for discrimination for `bilingual infants`_ where two native languages
are familiar. [#]_ Moreover, it appears that `bilingual infants`_ use a
different strategy than that used by `monolingual infants`_. [#]_

Analyses suggest a correlation across the world's languages between surface
rhythmicity and underlying syntax. Thus it has been hypothesized that surface
rhythm could bootstrap acquisition of syntax. This raises the possibility that
an ability to separate language on the basis of rhythmicity could assist the
bilingual infant in acquiring two separate grammars.

Visual cues
-----------

Much of the information that distinguishes one language from another auditorily
also is present in the visual cues on talking faces in the form of different
mouth gestures, rhythm and overall facial movement. [#]_ Yet the course of
development is again different between monolingual and bilingual infants. [#]_
Early bilingual experience allows infants to maintain sensitivity to language
differences in visual speech, a possible additional cue for language separation.

Setting up sound systems
===============================================================================

Very young infants are able to discriminate many `phonetic segments` that are
used in the world's languages, but over the first year of life sensitivity to
nonnative distinctions declines and discrimination of native distinctions
sharpens. Evidence suggests infants use distributional regularities in the input
to learn their native phonetic categories.

Bilingual infants simultaneously encounter `phonetic segments`_ from two
languages, each with its own distribution. Fluent adult bilinguals who acquired
both of their languages from birth can discriminate phonetic distinctions in
each of their languages, although they often perform better in their dominant
language. However, if they acquired one language after the other (sequential
bilingual), there are phonetic distinctions for which they show poorer
discrimination in the second language.

Recent evidence indicates that bilingual infants show a different pattern of
`phonotactic`_ learning from monolinguals. [#]_

.. _infant:
.. _infants:

Infant
    A child up to age 2

.. _bilingual infant:
.. _bilingual infants:

Bilingual infant
    An infant who has been raised in a bilingual environment from birth.

Language acquisition

.. _language discrimination:

Language discrimination
    The ability of `infants`_ to separate speech input into two languages in
    bilingual settings.

    `Infants`_ need to determine which differences between speakers are
    characteristic of the individual speaking and which are characteristic of
    the language they are using and then use this information in interactions
    with new speakers.

.. _monolingual infant:
.. _monolingual infants:

Monolingual infant
    An infant who has been raised in a monolingual environment from birth.

.. _orientation latency test:
.. _orientation latency tests:

Orientation latency test
    The test goes as follows:

    1. Infants are seated in a small room with hidden loudspeakers located to
       the left and right of the center, with each loudspeaker covered by a
       picture of a woman's face.
    2. Infants are familiarized to one type of stimulus which is presented
       randomly to either the left or right loudspeaker.
    3. During the test, the infant hears some trials with new stimuli of the
       same as type as during during the familiarization trials and other trials
       with a new stimuli of a different type in a consistent left-right
       configuration.
    4. The time that it takes the infant to orient toward the sound during each
       type of test trial is measured and compared.

.. _phonetic segment:
.. _phonetic segments:

Phonetic segment
    The individual consonant and vowel sounds that comprise syllables words.

    Phonetic segments are the smallest unit in language.

.. _phonotactic:
.. _phonotactics:

Phonotactics
    The rules for allowable sequences of phonemes of a language.

.. _rhythmical class:
.. _rhythmical classes:

Rhythmical class
    A set of languages distinguished by having the same rhythm.

    Roughly speaking, languages can be characterized as stress-timed, syllable
    timed, and mora-timed.
    
    These rhythmical categories have quantifiable acoustic correlates.

Footnotes
=========

.. [#] By 4-5 months of age, monolingual infants can discriminate their native
       language from another language with the same `rhythmical class`_, but
       cannot discriminate two unfamiliar languages from the same `rhythmical
       class`_.

.. [#] 4-month old Spanish-Catalan bilingual infants discriminate Spanish from
       Catalan as well as monolingual Catalan and monolingual Spanish infants
       learn do.

.. [#] This is evident because in `orientation latency tests`_ monolingual
       infants orient faster to their native language than bilingual infants do
       to either of theirs. The authors suggests that this is because bilingual
       infants try to identify which of their two languages is being spoken
       before oriented, thus increasing the latency of their response.

.. [#] Infants as young as 4 months can discriminate two languages from
       different rhythmical classes just by watching silent talking faces.

.. [#] Although successful at 4 and 6 months of age, monolingual English infants
       fail to discriminate the languages at 8 months, whereas bilingual
       French-English infants continue to succeed at this age.

.. [#] When tested at age 10 months, Spanish-Catalan bilinguals who were
       dominant in Catalan showed `phonotactic`_ preferences similar to
       same-aged Catalan monolinguals, whereas the performance of
       Spanish-dominant bilinguals was between that of Catalan and Spanish
       monolinguals.
