Coarticulatory influences
    The effect that the pronunciation of some sound has on the next.

    For instance, consider "foolish dancer" and "fearless dancer". In the
    former, the rounding of the lips from "sh" extends to the following "d". In
    the latter, the retracting of the lips from "s" extends to the "d".

    |ci|_ in speech result from vocal tract dynamics and are a major source of
    variability in the speech signal.

.. _compensation for coarticulation:

Compensation for coarticulation
    An example of |cfc| is that if a speaker produces a gesture with a front
    place of articulation, it may be pulled slightly backward if it follows a
    back place of articulation and listeners' phonetic category boundaries shift
    (compensate) accordingly. (Boundaries are distinguished by the frequency
    distribution of acoustic energy.)
    
    It is well known that listeners |pc|_ for the |ci|_ of one phoneme on the
    production of its neighbors and adjustment to such |ci| is thought to be
    among the most essential tasks of the early stages of processing in speech
    perception.

.. _scanning device:

Scanning device
    A mental device that tells whether a particular figure is a letter or some
    other figure or whether letters make a word or not.

    Selects information from |VIS|_ and passes it on for further processing.
