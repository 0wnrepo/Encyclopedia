Tachistoscope
    A tachistoscope is a device that displays an image for a specific amount of
    time. It can be used to increase recognition speed, to show something too
    fast to be consciously recognized, or to test which parts of an image are
    memorable. Tachistoscopes were used extensively in psychological research
    before computers became ubiquitous.

.. |VIS| replace:: visual information storage

Visual information storage
    A mental storage system in which information loss takes place.

    Sperling suggests it is a fast-decaying system for storing sensory
    information (e.g. information which has not made contract with the central
    processor or long-term memory).
    
    Presumably the |VIS| does not perform the same operations as the |SCAN|_.
