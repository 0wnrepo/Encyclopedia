Tachistoscope
    A tachistoscope is a device that displays an image for a specific amount of
    time. It can be used to increase recognition speed, to show something too
    fast to be consciously recognized, or to test which parts of an image are
    memorable. Tachistoscopes were used extensively in psychological research
    before computers became ubiquitous.

    Presumably the |VIS| does not perform the same operations as the |SCAN|_.
