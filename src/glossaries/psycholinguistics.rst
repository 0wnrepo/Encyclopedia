Coarticulatory influences
    The effect that the pronunciation of some sound has on the next.

    For instance, consider "foolish dancer" and "fearless dancer". In the
    former, the rounding of the lips from "sh" extends to the following "d". In
    the latter, the retracting of the lips from "s" extends to the "d".

    |ci|_ in speech result from vocal tract dynamics and are a major source of
    variability in the speech signal.

.. _compensation for coarticulation:

Compensation for coarticulation
    An example of |cfc| is that if a speaker produces a gesture with a front
    place of articulation, it may be pulled slightly backward if it follows a
    back place of articulation and listeners' phonetic category boundaries shift
    (compensate) accordingly. (Boundaries are distinguished by the frequency
    distribution of acoustic energy.)
    
    It is well known that listeners |pc|_ for the |ci|_ of one phoneme on the
    production of its neighbors and adjustment to such |ci| is thought to be
    among the most essential tasks of the early stages of processing in speech
    perception.

.. _forced-choice:

Forced choice procedure 
    As in the Reicher procedure.

Ganong Effect
    Subjects are more likely to perceive ambiguous speech sounds in a lexical
    context as consistent with the surrounding lexical.

    For instance, if an ambiguous speech sound is exactly between ``/t/`` and
    ``/d/``, a hearer might normally have difficult deciding what it is. But if
    the same sound is heard that the end of a word like ``woo/?/`` (where ``?``
    is the ambiguous sound) then the hear will likely perceive the sound as
    ``/d/``, presumably because ``wood`` is a word but ``woot`` is not.

.. _scanning device:

Scanning device
    A mental device that tells whether a particular figure is a letter or some
    other figure or whether letters make a word or not.

    Selects information from |VIS|_ and passes it on for further processing.

.. _vis:

Visual information storage (VIS)
    A mental storage system in which information loss takes place.

    Sperling suggests it is a fast-decaying system for storing sensory
    information (e.g. information which has not made contract with the central
    processor or long-term memory).
    
    Presumably the |VIS| does not perform the same operations as the |SCAN|_.

.. _visual masking:
.. _visual masking field:

Visual masking
    A reduction in the detectability of a brief visual stimulus by the
    presentation of a second stimulus (the masking stimulus).

.. |WSE| replace:: word superiority effect
.. _WSE:

Word superiority effect (WSE)
    The phenomenon that people have better recognition of letters presented
    within words as compared to isolated letters and to letters presented within
    nonword (orthographically illegal, unpronounceable letter array) strings
