Self-image
================================================================================

Three aspects of our self-concept are important in determining how well we
regard ourselves -- self-esteem, self-respect, and self-confidence, which are
mutually reinforcing.

Different types of personality, naturally, based their self-image on quite
different things. Having a good opinion of ourselves makes for our happiness.

Idealists
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most Idealists see themselves as empathetic, benevolent, and authentic.

Idealist self-esteem is greatest when they see themselves and are seen by other
as empathetic in bonding with people in their circle. Essentially, their
self-esteem the empathy they feel with those people closest to them-- it is the
most important thing in their lives. Their self-worth increases when
relationships are deeply connected and vital, and diminished when distanced or
troubled. Relationships span between partners, friends, family, and groups. They
seek to capture an elusive intimacy with others.

Idealists base their self-respect on their ability to maintain an attitude of
benevolence or goodwill toward other people. NFs are without question filled
with good intentions and will suppress enmity. They feel bad when thinking bad
things towards others and are troubled by hearing of cruelty in the world.

Idealist self-confidence rests on their authenticity. When inauthentic, they
can be taken over by self-doubt. Few are overtaken by this feeling, by some live
with a vague uncertainty about their genuineness. The problem for Idealists is
that this wish to be genuine at all times everywhere actually separates them
from the authenticity they demand of themselves; they are both actor and
director. Authenticity is also difficult because of their self-consciousness
from the eyes of others. They feel a need to be perceived well by others but
also be authentic.

Artisans
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most artisans see themselves as artistic, audacious, and adaptable.

Artisan self-esteem is great when they see themselves and are seen by others as
artistic in expediting and improving productions. Most artisans enjoy presenting
themselves as graceful in action, their sense of pride stemming from their
ability to act fluidly, beautifully, and with effortless freedom. On the other
hand, the artisan's greatest source of embarrassment is performing some action
poorly or awkwardly. Note, the artistic action of artisans is different from the
efficient action of rationals. Graceful action may be inefficient. 

Artisans see themselves and wish to be seen by other as bold, daring,
venturesome and audacious. The artisan's self respect depends upon their
ability to act fearlessly, to look danger in the eye and defeat it under any
circumstances. Boldness is a virtue to cultivate, and artisans feel guilty if
they are cowardly. Artisans are the world's greatest risk takers.

Artisans self-confidence rests on their ability to adapt to spontaneously to
changing circumstances, to alter and shape their behavior in the moment, in
order to operate effectively in the most unstable situations.

Soulmate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Idealists wish for a soulmate in a spouse, a spouse who knows their feelings
without being told of them, and who spontaneously expresses words of
endearment, words that acknowledge their mate's unique identity.
