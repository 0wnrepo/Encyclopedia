Plato
================================================================================

:Born: 428 BC
:Died: 348 BC (aged 80)

**Plato** was a philosopher in `classical Greece`_. He was also a mathematician,
student of Socrates_, author of many of the `Socratic dialogues`_, and founder
of `the Academy` in Athens_.

Philosophy
================================================================================

Plato was a `moral realist`, an `objectivist`, as opposed to a `moral
subjectivist` or `relativist`. In other words, Plato think that moral terms such
as "good", "right", and "just" designate real facts whose status is objective--
independent of an individual's or a culture's opinions, beliefs, customs, or
traditions. The moral relativist, on the other hand, believes that the truth
status of morality depends upon an individual's or a culture's beliefs, customs.

Plato think there certainly are moral facts and that humans can know them. He
argues for precisely this point in many of his dialogues; in others he assumes
it. [1]_
