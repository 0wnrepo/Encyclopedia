Connotation
================================================================================

Connotation is a translation of a sign_ to its associated meanings.

A sign connotes the attributes that each of the objects it denotes have in
common.

Example: (connotation "man") == {rationality, animality, ...}

Connotation determines denotation, but denotation does not determine
connotation.

:Example:
    "Triangle" and "Trilateral" denote the same things but have different
    connotations.

:Example:
    A child might know its brothers but not know the connotation of "brother".

Sometimes, we are never told the precise connotation of a term and form a
comprehension through an extended ostensive definition. This leads to issues of
vagueness_.
