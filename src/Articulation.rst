Articulation
================================================================================

Articulation is the movement of speech organs to make speech sound.

Articulatory phonetics is a branch of phonetics_ that studies the production of
speech sounds by the articulatory and vocal tract by the speaker.

Articulation is the final stage of `speech production`_.

Articulation has two parts:

2. Motor coordination
