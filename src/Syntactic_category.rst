Syntactic category
================================================================================

A **syntactic category** is a type of `syntactic unit` that theories of
`syntax`_ assume.

The traditional parts of speech (e.g. noun, verb, preposition, etc.) are
syntactic categories, and in `phrase structure grammars`, the phrasal categories
(e.g. noun phrase NP, verb phrase VP, prepositional phrase PP, etc.) are also
syntactic categories.

Instead of function, we're going to base the categories of words on other
criteria.

Syntactic categories are defined by distributional criteria, which may be either
morphological or syntactical. An instance, of a morphological criterion is the
prefix "-ly" identifying an adverb. An instance of a syntactic criteria would be
using the word "the" to identify the following word as a noun. Note, failure to
comply with criteria is not evidence that a word is not a in a syntactic
category.

Kinds
================================================================================

Lexical category
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lexical category is (for class) any open class category.

Lexical categories are "open class" meaning we can invent new ones (via
neologism_).

They tend to have meaning.

Noun (N)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A noun is a person, place or thing.

Identifying nouns.

1. Can add -s to make the word plural

2. Can fit in the frame [the _].

3. Can function as subject in the frame  [the _ is/are nice].

.. todo: obviously this misses Proper nouns

Verb (V)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbs have constraints.

Verbs see to have special requirements. (Theta theory, argument structure)

One way to divide up verbs is based on their arity or argument structure. For
instance "Alice smiled" versus "Alice loves pink".

A predicate is a function. For example, smile is a 1-place predicate (or
intransitive verb).

A n-place predicate takes exactly n arguments.

An intransitive verb is a 1-place predicate that is a verb.
(Consider eat though, which takes two, but I ate takes one.) For instance,
arrived.

A transitive verb is a 2-place predicate that is a verb. For example, "Alice
chose Bob".

A ditransitive verb is a 3-place predicate that is a verb. For example, "Alice
gave Bob candy" or "Alice told Bob the secret" or "Alice put the book on the
shelf."

0-place predicates. For example, "It is snowing".

Note: Things don't have meaning (such as "It" in the above sentence are of
special interest to syntacticians).

Note: When looking at data that is not in English there are three parts we're
interested. We'll have data, which is the foreign language, gloss is the literal
translation, and then we have the actual translation.

Identifying lexical verbs.

1. Can add "-ing" to form a progressive

2. Can add "-ed" to form a past tense

3. Can follow "will" in the frame ["John will _"]

"is" will break this. "is" is an auxiliary and is a functional category.

"John was devouring" implies a background.

Adjective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identifying adjectives.

1. Usually precedes a noun and modifies. "John is a _ person."

2. Can usually be the sole predicate of "be" as in [John is _]

3. Can add prefix "un-" to get another adjective, suffix "-ly" to get adverb.

Adverb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identifying adverbs.

1. Ends with "ly". Exceptions "fly", "friendly", "soon"

2. Negative test: Adverbs cannot be the predicate of "be" [John is _]

3. Can often add "-er" to make it comparative. "sooner"

Functional category
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A functional category is ...

Functional categories are mostly "closed class".

Determiner (D)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A determiner is a word_ or phrase_ that serves to express the reference of a
noun or noun phrase in the context.

In English, common determiners include "the", "a", "my", and "some".

Determiners:

1. Can appear before a noun.

2. There, a, an, this, that, these, those, every, some

Preposition (P)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A preposition is a class of words that express spatial or temporal relations.

For example, "in", "under", "towards", "before", "around", and "of".

1. Can be modified by [right _]

2. Often concern location and time.

Complementizer (C)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Negation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

not, n't

Conjunction (Conj)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and, or

Tense (T)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modal

can, could, will, would, may, should, shall

Non-finite

to

Auxiliary

be, have

Nominalization
==============

Nominalization is the use of a verb, adjective, or an adverb, as a noun.

The division between nouns and adjectives is a strictly syntactical one, as can
be seen via nominalization:

Example: "The legislation will have the most impact of the poor"
Example: "The Socialist International"
