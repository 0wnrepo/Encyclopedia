Syntactic category
================================================================================

A **syntactic category** is a type of `syntactic unit` that theories of
`syntax`_ assume.

The traditional parts of speech (e.g. noun, verb, preposition, etc.) are
syntactic categories, and in phrase structure grammars, the phrasal categories
(e.g. noun phrase NP, verb phrase VP, prepositional phrase PP, etc.) are also
syntactic categories.

Instead of function, we're going to base the categories of words on other
criteria.

Parts of speech are defined by distributional criteria, which may be either
morphological or syntactical. An instance, of a morphological criterion is the
prefix "-ly" identifying an adverb. An instance of a syntactic criteria would be
using the word "the" to identify the following word as a noun.

Kinds
================================================================================

Lexical category
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lexical category is (for class) any open class category.

Lexical categories are "open class" meaning we can invent new ones. They tend to
have meaning.

Noun (N)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A noun is a person, place or thing.

Verb (V)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbs have constraints.

One way to divide up verbs is based on their arity or argument structure. For
instance "Alice smiled" versus "Alice loves pink".

A predicate is a function. For example, smile is a 1-place predicate (or
intransitive verb).

A n-place predicate takes exactly n arguments.

An intransitive verb is a 1-place predicate that is a verb.
(Consider eat though, which takes two, but I ate takes one.) For instance,
arrived.

A transitive verb is a 2-place predicate that is a verb. For example, "Alice
chose Bob".

A ditransitive verb is a 3-place predicate that is a verb. For example, "Alice
gave Bob candy" or "Alice told Bob the secret" or "Alice put the book on the
shelf."

0-place predicates. For example, "It is snowing".

Note: Things don't have meaning (such as "It" in the above sentence are of
special interest to syntacticians).

Note: When looking at data that is not in English there are three parts we're
interested. We'll have data, which is the foreign language, gloss is the literal
translation, and then we have the actual translation.

Adjective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adverb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functional category

A functional category is ...

Functional categories are mostly"closed class".

Determiner (D)

("the", "a")

Preposition (P)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complementizer (C)

Negation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

not, n't

Conjunction (Conj)

and, or

Tense (T)

Identification
================================================================================

Identifying nouns.

1. If the word can fit in the frame [the _].

2. Add -s to make the word plural

3. Can function as subject in the frame  [the _ is/are nice].

If a lexical item doesn't pass these test, it doesn't mean it's not a noun.
Negative evidence is not really evidence, but we need more tests.

Identifying lexical verbs.

1. Can add "-ing" to form a progressive

2. Can add "-ed" to form a past tense

3. Can follow "will" in the frame ["John will _"]

"is" will break this. "is" is an auxiliary and is a functional category.

"John was devouring" implies a background.

Identifying adjectives.

1. Usually precedes a noun and modifies. "John is a _ person."

2. Can usually be the sole predicate of "be" as in [John is _]

3. Can add prefix "un-" to get another adjective, suffix "-ly" to get adverb.

Identifying adverbs.

1. Ends with "ly". Exceptions "fly", "friendly", "soon"

2. Negative test: Adverbs cannot be the predicate of "be" [John is _]

3. Can often add "-er" to make it comparative. "sooner"

Determiners:

1. Can appear before a noun.

2. There, a, an, this, that, these, those, every, some

Prepositions.

1. Can be modified by [right _], on, in, around

2. Often concern location and time. "of"
