Sign
================================================================================

A sign is a thing that is understood to denote something other than itself.

A sign is something physical, perceivable by our senses; it refers to
something other than itself; and it depends upon a recognition by its user
that it *is* a sign.[2]

Example: A picture of a pipe is a sign of a pipe
Example: "Snow" is a sign of snow
Example: Pulling my earlobe as a sign to auctioneer[2]
Example: Blushing might be thought of as a signal signifying an internal state of embarrassment[5]
Example: Saying "this is very embarassing" might be thought of as a signal signifying an internal state of embarrassment[5]
Example: The distended belly of the female stickleback signals the male to initiate an elaborate courtship routine that culminates in fertilization of her eggs[4]
Example: Upon returning to its hive, a foraging honeybee communicates the direction and distance of a source of nectar by engaging in an elaborate waggle-dance[4]
Example: Vervet monkeys (native to East Africa) have three distinctive vocal alarm calls that signal the presence of leopards, eagles and snakes, their three main predators. Upon hearing one or another call, a Vervet will respond appropriately--climbing a tree in response to the leopard call, scanning the ground when the snake call is sounded.[4]

## Aristotle

A sign is a material for constructing enthymemes.[3] Aristotle divided signs into two kinds:

1. Infallible signs
2. Fallible (Ordinary) signs

1. Infallible signs necessarily bear a relation.

    * "The fact that he has a fever is a sign that he is ill,"
    * "The fact that she is giving milk is a sign that she has lately borne a child."
    
2. Fallible signs ...

    * "The fact that Socrates was wise and just is a sign that the wise are just." Here we certainly have a Sign; but even though the proposition be true, the argument is refutable, since it does not form a syllogism.
    * "The fact that he breathes fast is a sign that he has a fever." This argument also is refutable, even if the statement about the fast breathing be true, since a man may breathe hard without having a fever.


# Analysis

Two dominant models of signs exist:

1. Ferdinand de Saussure
2. C.S. Peirce

# Analysis

> A sign is something what stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person and equivalent sign, or perhaps a more developed sign. The sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for something, its object. (In Zeman 1977)
> I define a sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its interpretant, that the later is thereby mediately determined by the former. (Pierce)

Meaning consists of three interrelated parts:

1. Sign
2. Object
3. Interpretant

Note: The interpretant is not the user of the sign, but 'the proper significate effect': a mental concept produced both by the sign and by the user's experience of the object.

Example: The interpretant of the word 'school' in any one context will be the result of the user's experience of that word and of his experience of institutions called 'schools', the object.

The interpretant is not fixed (defined by a dictionary) but may vary within limits according to the experience of the user.

The limits are set by social convention (in this case, conventions of the English language); the variation within them allows for social and psychological differences between the users.

Each can only be understood in terms of the others.

1. (sign-object)        A sign refers to something other than itself - the object
2. (sign-interpretant)  A sign is understood by somebody; it has an effect in the mind of the user -- the interpretant.

# Classification

    Every sign is determined by its object, either first, by partaking in the
    character of the object, when I call the sign an Icon; secondly, by being
    really and in its individual existence connected with the individual object,
    when I call the sign an Index; thirdly, by more or less approximate
    certainty that it will be interpreted as denoting the object in consequence
    of a habit...when I call the sign a Symbol. (In Zeman, 1977)[1]

Signs fits a category depending on the intention of sender and interpretation of the viewer.

At the highest level, three kinds of signs exist:

1. Index_ (natural, indexical)
2. Icon_ (intentional, indexical)
3. Symbol_ (intentional, arbitrary)

These categories are not separate and distinct. One sign may be composed of various types.[1]

# Sign (Saussure)

Roughly, a sign is a physical object with a meaning.[1]

# History

Saussure, as a linguist, was primarily interested in language.[1]

Saussure was more concerned with the way signs related to other sign than he was with the way they related to Peirce's object, so the emphasis is different, on the sign.[1]

# Terms

The terms motivation and constraint are used to describe the extent to which the signified determines the signifier: they are almost interchangeable.

A highly motivated sign is a very iconic one.

Example: a photograph is more highly motivated than a road sign.

An arbitrary sign is unmotivated.

Or we can use the term constraint to refer to the influence which the signified exerts on the signifier.

The more motivated the sign is, the more its signifier is constrained by the signified.

Example: a photograph is highly motivated since it is determined mainly by what the subject looks like (framing, focus, lighting, etc. produce an arbitrary element in the final sign)
Example: a painted portrait is less motivated
Example: a cartoon is less motivated (less constrained)

Example: an unmotivated arbitrary sign is the word "man" itself

The less motivated the sign is, the more important it is for us to have learned the convetions agreed among the users; without them, the sign remains meaningless, or liable to wildly aberrant decoding.[1]

# Analysis

A sign consists of: 

1. A signifier
2. A signified

Note: Both the signifier and the signified are form rather than substance.
Note: There is no necessary relationship between signifier and signified.[1] The relationship is determined by convention, rule, or agreement.

## Signifier

A signifier is a physical form that a sign takes; the perceivable part of the sign.[1]

Example: marks on paper
Example: sounds in the air
Example: "s-h-i-p"
Example: _green_, _yellow, and _red_  signifier for traffic signals

Note: These signifiers use only one of the five sensory channels.
Note: Signifiers must provide a safety margin of discreteness. (redundancy)
Note: No meaningless signifier exists.
Note: A signifier could stand for a different signified in a different context.
Note: Many signifiers could stand for the same signified.

## Signified

A signified is a (mental) concept to which a sign refers.[1]

Example: _ship_ signifies 'ship'
Example: _green_ signifies 'go', _yellow_ signifies 'prepare to stop', _red_ signifies 'stop'

The mental concept is broadly common to all members of the same culture who share the same language.[1]

A signified may be broken down into semes.

Example: 'ship' contains semes such as /navigation/ and /concrete/. 

An isotopy is created by the repetition of one seme.

Example: In "There was a fine ship, carved from solid gold / With azure reaching masts, on seas unknown" the words "ship", "masts", and "seas" all contain the seme /navigation/.

Signification is the relationship between a user's concept of some thing and its physical reality.[1]

Signified is a product of culture as much as the signifiers.[1] It obvious that signifiers change from language to language, but it easy to fall into the fallacy of believe that the signified are universal and that translation is therefore a simple matter of substituting a French word, say for an English one.[1]

# Sign & System

To understand a sign, one must understand the sign relationship between the sign and other signs in the same system: that is, the relationship between a sign and other signs that it could conceivably be, but is not.[1]

Example: The meaning of the sign "man" is determined by how it is differentiated from other signs. So "man" can mean "not animal" or "not human" or "not rational".[1]
Example: When Chanel chose the French star Catherine Deneuve to give their perfume an image of a particular kind of sophisticated traditional French chic, she became a sign in a system. And the meaning of Catherine- Deneuve-as-sign was determined by other beautiful stars-as-signs that she was not. She was not Susan Hampshire (too English); she was not Twiggy (too young, trendy, changeably fashionable); she was not Brigitte Bardot (too unsophisticatedly sexy); and so on.[1]

Signifieds are the mental concepts we used to divide reality up and categorize it so that we can understand it.[1]

The boundaries between categories are artificial.[1]

Example: There is no line between man and boy until we draw one.

The signification of a sign is determined not by the nature of that reality/experience but by the boundaries of the related signifies in the system.[1]

Meaning is therefore better defined by the relationships of one sign to another than by the relationship of that sign to an external reality.[1]

# Value

Value is the relationship of the sign to others in its system.[1]

Value is what primarily determines meaning.[1]

Signs have no value in themselves; the 'value' of a sign depends on its relations with other signs within the system.

Analogy: In the game of chess, the value of each piece depends on its position on the chessboard.

Note: A one-term language is impossible because its single term could be applied to everything and differentiate nothing.

> Although the signifier is treated by its user as 'standing for' the signified, Saussurean semioticians emphasize that there is no necessary, intrinsics, direct, or inevitable relationship between the signifier and the signified.
> Saussure stressed the arbitrariness of the sign - more specifically, the arbitrariness of the link between the signifier and the signified.

Note: the above only applies to language and written words. And even this has except, for instance, onomatopoeia, though arguably the exceptions are entirely insignificant. 

> each language involves different distinctions between one signifier and another (e.g. 'tree' and 'free') and between one signified and another (e.g 'tree' and 'bush')

# Classification

A signifier has an iconic relationship with the signified if it resembles the signified.[1]
A signifier has an arbitrary relationship with the signified if the two are related only by agreement.[1]

> A linguistic sign is not a link between a thing and a name, but between a concept [signified] and a sound pattern [signifier]. The sound pattern is not actually a sound; for a sound is something physical. A sound pattern is the hearer's impression of a sound, as given to him by the evidence of his senses. The sound pattern may be called a 'material' element only in that it is the representation of our sensory impressions. The sound pattern may thus be distinguished from the other element associated with it in a linguistic sign. This other element is generally of a more abstract kind: the concept. - Saussure, 1983

# Habit (Convention)

Habit plays an important variety of roles in communication and signification.

At its most formal level it can describe the rules by which arbitrary signs work.

Example: There is formal convention that the sign "cat" refers to cats

There are also less formal, less explicitly expressed, conventions.

Example: slow motion (analysis of skill or error, or appreciation of beauty)

Our experience of similar signs (experience of convention) enables us to respond appropriately.

Example: We do not mistake slow motion for people running slowly
Example: Our experience of the content tells us whether to appreciate beauty or analyze skill

Convention is necessary to the understanding of any sign, however iconic or indexical it is.[1]

Example: we need to learn how to understand a photograph
Example: we need to learn how to understand a life-size waxwork

Convention is the social dimension of signs.[1]

Convention is the agreement among the users about the appropriate uses and responses to a sign.[1]

Signs with no conventional dimension are purely private and thus do not communicate.[1]

It may be of more help to consider the distinction between arbitrary and iconic as a scale, not as separate categories.[1]

At one end of the sign we have the purely arbitrary, conventional, unmotivated, unconstrained sign.

At the other end we have the notional pure icon (which cannot exist in practice-- a pure icon would have to be the thing itself).[1]

# Organization (structural relationships)

Saussure defined two ways in which signs are organized into codes:

1. Paradigms (choice)
2. Syntagmatic (combination)

## Paradigm

A paradigm is a set of signs from which the one to be used is chosen.

A paradigm is a set from which a choice is made and only unit from that set may be chosen.

Example: The set of shape for road signs (square, round triangular) forms a paradigm
Example: The set of symbols that go with them
Example: a lexicon
Example: letters of the alphabet (written language)
Example: ways of changing shots in television (cut, fad, dissolve, wipe)
Example: headgear (trilby, cap, beret, stetson)
Example: style of chars
Example: type of car
Example: the color we paint our front door
Example: harrmony

All messages involve selection from a paradigm.

Every time we communicate we must select from a paradigm.

The meaning of the unit we choose is determined largely by the meaning of the units we did not.

Where there is choice there is meaning and the meaning of what was chosen is determined by the meaning of what was not.[1]

Characteristics:

1. All the units in a paradigm must share something in common.

The unit in a paradigm must share characteristics that determine their membership of that paradigm

Example: We must know that M is a letter and thus a member of the alphabetic paradigm
Example: We must know that 5 is not a letter

2. Each unit must be clearly distinguished from all the others in the paradigm.

We must be able to tell the difference between signs in a paradigm in terms of bother their signifiers and their signified.

The distinctive features of a sign are the means by which we distinguish one signifier from another.[1]

Example: bad handwriting blurs the distinctive features of letters


---

There is an assumption here that a paradigm has more than once choice; but sometimes the only choice is to single or not.

Example: yelling "danger!" signals danger, but the absence of it signals? no danger-- vervets cannot be explained if they only had one call
