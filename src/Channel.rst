Channel
================================================================================

A channel is a medium_ used to transmit a signal_ from a transmitter to a
receiver_.[1]

A channel is a physical mean by which the signal_ is transmitted.[2]

A communication channel is a medium through which a message is transmitted.

> The channel refers to this intermediate area between the source and the receiver.[3]

> A channel can refer to the media or sensory modality involved. In the case of media, the frame of reference is frequently the source, which transmits the message. In the case of modality, the frame of reference is the receiver who is the beneficiary. [3]

Example: a pair of wires
Example: a coaxial cable
Example: a band of radio frequencies
Example: a beam of light
Example: sound waves
Example: radio waves
Example: numerous system
Example: vision
Example: sound
Example: face-to-face
Example: chat over the phone
Example: Facebook
Example: Twitter
Example: blogs
Example: email
Example: texting
Example: push notification
Example: visual
Example: auditory
Example: a wire (transmission medium)
Example: a cable (multiple wires running together)
Example: radio (logical connection)

Properties
================================================================================

The physical characteristics of a channel determines the nature of codes_ that
it can transmit.[2]

Example: the telephone is limited to verbal language and paralanguage

A channel has a certain capacity for transmitting information.

A channel may be noisy.

A channel may convey more than one medium.

# Purpose

A communication channel carries a signal to a destination.

A channel is used to transmit an information signal from a sender to a receiver.

--

# Division

A channel is either a transmission medium or logical connection over a multiplexed medium.

## Transmission Medium

A transmission medium is a material substance that can propagate energy waves.

Example: air (sound)
Example: vacuum (electromagnetic waves: light, radio)

Waves are usually affected by the transmission media they pass through at the interfaces of media.

Example: absorption
Example: reflection
Example: refraction

A transmission medium is either guided (wired) or unguided (wirless).

Example: twisted-paired cable (guided)
Example: coaxial cable (guided)
Example: fiber-optic cable (guided)
