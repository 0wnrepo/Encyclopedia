Perceptual learning
================================================================================

Perceptual learning is the process of learning improved skills of perception_.
These improvements range from simple sensory discriminations (e.g.,
distinguishing two musical tones from one another) to complex categorizations of
spatial and temporal patterns relevant to real-world expertise (e.g., reading,
seeing relations among chess pieces, knowing whether or not an X-ray image shows
a tumor).

Extensive practice reading in English leads to extraction and rapid processing
of the structural regularities of English spelling patterns. (See `word
superiority effect`_.)
