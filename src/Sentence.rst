Sentence
================================================================================

A sentence is a grammatical unit of one or more `words` that are grammatically
linked.

Sentences have hierarchical structure and constituent structure.

Some words have certain structural requirements. (Binding theory)

Verbs see to have special requirements. (Theta theory, argument structure)

The form a noun matters.

Question formation is subject to structural constraints.

- Mary saw that movie that Betty loves? (How do we question who Betty was?)

Strings of words that look very similar might not have the same structure.

Sentences are either grammatical or ungrammatical. Grammatical sentences may be
prescriptively OK or not. If so, they may be uncontroversially so, formally so
(e.g. "To whom am I speaking?", i.e. something which must be taught), difficult
to parse ("Cheese mice love stinks." or "I saw the man with the telescope."),
semantically anomalous ("Blue is circular."). Non-prescriptive may be either
dialectical ("The car needs washed.") or informal ("Me and John went to the
store.").

Notation: ``*`` means ungrammatical, ``%`` usually means dialectical variant.

Classification
==============

Sentences can be classified based on their purpose:

- Interrogative sentence:

- Declarative sentence:

- Imperative sentence:

- Exclamatory sentence:

## Interrogative Sentence (Question)

A question is a very safe move on a part of a conversationalist because it  has no connotation of judgment or power. Consequently, other forms of getting information are better because they risk they incur demonstrates confidence.

### Question

### Request

## Declarative Sentence (Statement)

A statement is a meaningful declarative sentence that is either true or false.

Example: "Socrates is a man".

Counter-example: "Greenness perambulates". Though a declarative sentence, it is nonsense, so it is not a statement.

Many questions can be transformed into statements:

Example: Are you tired of meeting weird guys? => You must be tired of meeting weird guys. 

Such transformations usually start with:

- "So...", "Then..." 
- "You must..." 
- "You could..." 
- "It must be..." 

Making a statement demonstrates confidence because it is less safe then asking a question. A statement takes a position, and it introduces the possibility of disagreement.

### Suggestion

## Imperative Sentence (Command)

An imperative sentence tells someone to do something.

> What school do you go to? 
> => So tell me what school you're from 

> How was your day? 
> => Tell me about your day 

Making a imperative sentence demonstrates confidence in one's position over another. In they comply, they've submitted.

## Exclamatory Sentence

# Stories


# Genuine Interest

People love talking about themselves and enjoy the company of those who take a genuine interest in them.

By doing this (in the right way), you let her talk about herself, but you control what she is talking about. You don't want to hear about her personal problems (intellectual whore). You just jump in every once-in-a-while with a "me too" statement to let her know that you guys are connecting. You GUIDE the conversation completely. This puts you in control. When the conversation starts heading off track, you bring it back.

Take a genuine interest in what she's saying. Don't try to fake it. When she tells you she went to Europe for 3 months, don't say, "That's cool." That's a big thing. Ask her about it. What did she like? Where in Europe did she go? What were the people like? What differences are there between Europe and the US? You could talk to her for hours just about her trip.

Tips

1. Always be aware of your surroundings! 
    - Some of the best conversation starters are based on what's going on around you. Maybe something funny happened, maybe there's a guy that looks like Tom Hanks. Maybe the girl dropped her cell phone in water. Whatever is going on around you, learn to use it to your advantage. 
    - Ways to practice this: When you go out, look for things happening to people or in your surroundings. Then, approach anyone (guy or girl) and talk to him or her about it. Make it seem smooth and if you can, funny. Then, let that lead into more conversation. This is probably the best way to do a Cold Approach IMO.
2. Don't ask random questions! 
    - This isn't 20 questions. Don't ask a girl a question and then proceed by asking her a totally unrelated question when she answers. Keep the questions related to her answer. Base what you say off of her response. DON'T PLAN OUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY NEXT. Go with the flow. 
    - Good
        - Guy: Do you live around here? 
        - Girl: I actually live about 20 min away in __ 
        - Guy: Really? I hear they listen to quite a bit of rap in __ (just an example) 
        - Girl: Yeah they do! I'm not too big on rap though. I prefer acoustic bands like John Mayer or Dave Matthews 
        - Guy: Dave was just up at the Gorge for a concert last week. Did you see the concert? 
        - Girl: I really wanted to go but got stuck working the whole weekend 
        - Guy: etc etc 
    - Bad
        - Guy: Do you live around here? 
        - Girl: I actually live about 20 min away in __ 
        - Guy: Cool. What kind of music do you listen to? 
        - Girl: My favorite would have to be any acoustic bands 
        - Guy: Did you go to the Dave Matthews Concert? 
        - Girl: No, I got stuck working 
        - Guy: Where do you work? 
3. Keep the Conversations Positive 
    - There's nothing people hate more than a negative person. You know the type: Those people that complain and argue about EVERYTHING. Always try to avoid anything negative.
    - NEVER whine or complain and don't argue. 
4. Understand people have opinions where there is no right or wrong 
    - I've met so many people who always have to argue with people's opinions. That's just their way of thinking. Don't agree with a girl just for the sake of agreeing. If you have a difference of opinion, and think you can back it up, then let her know you disagree, but do it in an adult-like manner. Don't insult her way of thinking. Just like you, she probably has reasoning for her opinion. You could ask her what her reasoning is behind that. Throw in your point of view, but acknowledge her points. 
5. Noun-ing 
    - This is a technique I read about that will help those of you who have trouble with conversation. You'll be able to hold a conversation without a problem. It could start with the simplest of questions like, "What did you do today?" You'll learn to do this with practice without even thinking about it, but for now, here's how you do it. (this is taken from another post) 
    - Example
        - Guy: So what do you do with yourself? 
        - Girl: Oh, Im in Trinity College in Dublin studying Law. 
        - Take the nounf of this reply:
            - Trinity College
            - Dublin
            - Law
        - Pick any of these and ask a question about it!
6. Use Open-Ended Questions 
7. Men want facts; women want feelings
    - This of course is a generalization that I read somewhere: Men like to cut to the facts. They don't like all the small talk and stuff in between. Men organize thoughts in their head and then say what needs to be said. Women use talking as a means to organize their thoughts. 

# Syntactic Frame Generation (Sentence-Structure) (Surface Form)

Sentence production has three parts:

1. Building a syntactic structure whose elementary units are words
2. Building any morphologically complex words out of existing morphemes
3. Building the sound structure of individual words out of phonemes

The alternative to building a representation is retrieving a representation.

### Inflection


#### Attraction

The presence of non-subject plural nouns in an utterance creates a tendency toward a type of error in agreement called "attraction".

For example, "The time for fun and games are over".

Attraction reveals some of the mechanisms behind language production.

1. Attraction respects structural boundaries: verbs are more attracted to nouns in their immediate structural vicinity that in their immediate temporal vicinity.
    - For example, they are more attracted to nouns in other clauses, even when both nouns immediately precede the verb.
2. Attracted verbs do not simply take whatever number is seemingly dictated by a neighboring noun.
    - For example, plurals are more likely to create attraction than singulars. This means that attraction is not the mistaken implementation of agreement with something that is not the subject; if it were, errors like "The king of he islands were cruel" (plural attraction) and "The kings of the island was cruel" (singular attraction) should be about equally likely. It seems what goes wrong is not agreement with the wrong subject, but rather agreement with the right subject that has somehow acquired the wrong number.

#### Structural Priming

Structural priming refers to the tendency for speakers to echo the structures of utterances they have recently heard or said themselves.

Speakers do so even when the words and meaning conveyed by the echoed structure change between the first and subsequent occasion of use.

For example:

> B: Repeating patterns (is what you have to check for) when you buy your paper
> A: That (is what I needed) and I didn't think about that. I got a Mickey Mouse print (is what I got).

There are two competing theoretical accounts of structural priming:

1. One rests on activation in so-called combinatorial nodes that are claimed to be responsible for sentence structure. Because combinatorial nodes are linked to words with corresponding syntactic priveliges, this approached readily explains the lexical enhancement of structural priming.

2. One emphasis the abstract structure building behind priming and its persistance. An explicity model of the process treats priming as a kind of implicit learning with natural links to language acquisiton in children.

Structure building and lexical selection are (heavily) dependent on one another.
    - That Speakers are more likely to echo a recently heard structure whn what they say also repeats a word from a priming structure is one consequence of this dependence. It can be interpreted in terms of the binding that must occur between words and structures at the outset of sentence formulation.
    - Some words are easier to retrieve than others; they are more accessible. Accessible information tends to be produced before less accessible information provided there is a structure into which it fits.

#### Incrementality

Incrementality is a require of the process of spoken language production, simply because the vocal output channel is heavily restricted in what it can do. Words and syllables that compose them are uttered one at a time even when two words erroneously blend toget in speech (e.g. slickery, flustrated); they blend as a single word.

The question this poses for theories of production are:

1. How incremental are the psycholinguistic preparation processes in the run up to speaking?

2. What are the units of incrementation?

3. What is the target of incrementation?

Incrementation can be both hierarchical and linear. The distinction between these two types of incrementation was drawn in terms of the timing of eye movements.

When speakers describe events in single sentences, their eye fixations on specific elements on the events tend to systematically precede the mention of those events during fluent speech. This finding suggests that at some level, planning may proceed roughly in terms of words or phrase in the order in which they occur. 

However, the existence of an underlying hierarchical component to planning is suggested by increased gaze duration, longer fixation latencies, and longer latencies to speech at the onset of utterances. This implies that in preparing an utterance, the scope of a plan extends beyond the upcoming word.

---

* The speech that adult address to infants consists mostly of multiword utterances.

* The building of sentence structure is one of the most (1) crucial but (2) least understood facets of language production. Crucial because without a facilities for assembling novel arrangements of words quickly, speakers would be unable to adapt old thought to expression in new settings or to convey new ideas to anyone.
