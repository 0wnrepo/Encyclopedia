Sentence
================================================================================

A sentence is a grammatical unit of one or more words_ that are `grammatically
related`_.

The study of sentences is syntax_.

A simple sentence usually consists of a single finite clause_ with a finite verb
that is independent. Complex sentences may contain multiple clauses_.

Classification
================================================================================

Sentences may be classified based on their purpose:

- Interrogative sentence

- Declarative sentence

- Imperative sentence

- Exclamatory sentence

Interrogative Sentence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An interrogative sentence is ...

A question is a very safe move on a part of a conversationalist because it  has no connotation of judgment or power. Consequently, other forms of getting information are better because they risk they incur demonstrates confidence.

### Question

Many questions can be transformed into statements:

:Example:
    Are you tired of meeting weird guys? => You must be tired of meeting weird guys. 

Question formation is subject to structural constraints.

:Example:
    Mary saw that movie that Betty loves? (How do we question who Betty was?)

Such transformations usually start with:

- "So...", "Then..." 
- "You must..." 
- "You could..." 
- "It must be..." 

### Request

Declarative Sentence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See: Statement_, Suggestion

Imperative Sentence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An imperative sentence tells someone to do something.

    What school do you go to? => Tell me what school you go to

    How was your day? => Tell me about your day 

Making a imperative sentence demonstrates confidence in one's position over
another. If they comply, they've submitted.

Exclamatory Sentence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntactic Frame Generation (Sentence-Structure) (Surface Form)
================================================================================

Sentence production has three parts:

1. Building a syntactic structure whose elementary units are words

2. Building any morphologically complex words out of existing morphemes

3. Building the sound structure of individual words out of phonemes

The alternative to building a representation is retrieving a representation.

Inflection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attraction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The presence of non-subject plural nouns in an utterance creates a tendency toward a type of error in agreement called "attraction".

For example, "The time for fun and games are over".

Attraction reveals some of the mechanisms behind language production.

1. Attraction respects structural boundaries: verbs are more attracted to nouns in their immediate structural vicinity that in their immediate temporal vicinity.
    - For example, they are more attracted to nouns in other clauses, even when both nouns immediately precede the verb.
2. Attracted verbs do not simply take whatever number is seemingly dictated by a neighboring noun.
    - For example, plurals are more likely to create attraction than singulars. This means that attraction is not the mistaken implementation of agreement with something that is not the subject; if it were, errors like "The king of he islands were cruel" (plural attraction) and "The kings of the island was cruel" (singular attraction) should be about equally likely. It seems what goes wrong is not agreement with the wrong subject, but rather agreement with the right subject that has somehow acquired the wrong number.

Structural Priming
================================================================================

Structural priming refers to the tendency for speakers to echo the structures of
utterances they have recently heard or said themselves.

Speakers do so even when the words and meaning conveyed by the echoed structure change between the first and subsequent occasion of use.

For example:

> B: Repeating patterns (is what you have to check for) when you buy your paper
> A: That (is what I needed) and I didn't think about that. I got a Mickey Mouse print (is what I got).

There are two competing theoretical accounts of structural priming:

1. One rests on activation in so-called combinatorial nodes that are claimed to be responsible for sentence structure. Because combinatorial nodes are linked to words with corresponding syntactic priveliges, this approached readily explains the lexical enhancement of structural priming.

2. One emphasis the abstract structure building behind priming and its persistance. An explicity model of the process treats priming as a kind of implicit learning with natural links to language acquisiton in children.

Structure building and lexical selection are (heavily) dependent on one another.
    - That Speakers are more likely to echo a recently heard structure whn what they say also repeats a word from a priming structure is one consequence of this dependence. It can be interpreted in terms of the binding that must occur between words and structures at the outset of sentence formulation.
    - Some words are easier to retrieve than others; they are more accessible. Accessible information tends to be produced before less accessible information provided there is a structure into which it fits.

Incrementality
================================================================================

Incrementality is a require of the process of spoken language production, simply because the vocal output channel is heavily restricted in what it can do. Words and syllables that compose them are uttered one at a time even when two words erroneously blend toget in speech (e.g. slickery, flustrated); they blend as a single word.

The question this poses for theories of production are:

1. How incremental are the psycholinguistic preparation processes in the run up to speaking?

2. What are the units of incrementation?

3. What is the target of incrementation?

Incrementation can be both hierarchical and linear. The distinction between these two types of incrementation was drawn in terms of the timing of eye movements.

When speakers describe events in single sentences, their eye fixations on specific elements on the events tend to systematically precede the mention of those events during fluent speech. This finding suggests that at some level, planning may proceed roughly in terms of words or phrase in the order in which they occur. 

However, the existence of an underlying hierarchical component to planning is suggested by increased gaze duration, longer fixation latencies, and longer latencies to speech at the onset of utterances. This implies that in preparing an utterance, the scope of a plan extends beyond the upcoming word.

---

* The speech that adult address to infants consists mostly of multiword utterances.

* The building of sentence structure is one of the most (1) crucial but (2) least understood facets of language production. Crucial because without a facilities for assembling novel arrangements of words quickly, speakers would be unable to adapt old thought to expression in new settings or to convey new ideas to anyone.
