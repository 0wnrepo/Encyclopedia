:Abstract:
    The goal of this chapter is to illustrate how developing and testing
    computational models can inform us about the psychological processes
    involved in perceiving, recognizing, and categorizing the world.

    To simplify the discussion, we focus on the question of how we perceive
    letters and words.

    This chapter promotes the value of computational models in the enterprise of
    understanding how humans accomplish feats such as pattern recognition.

Introduction

- When faced with a written word we seem to have no choice but to read it.
  (Stroop effect - 1935). Reading words is such an overlearned skill, it is not
  easily put on hold. Achieving this level of reading skill takes time. Reading
  is a remarkably complex skill.
  
- In addition to being experts in letter recognition, we are especially good at
  recognizing them when they spell words. Our knowledge of spelling and the
  context provided by other letters of a word help us recognize individual
  letters within words.

Domains of pattern recognition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I use the term "pattern recognition" to describe what is commonly meant by
    perception, recognition, identification, and categorization.

Perception describes our awareness of some environmental event.

Recognition means recognizing something we experienced previously.

Identification involves making a unique response to each unique stimulus.

Categorization means placing several noticeably different stimuli into the same
category.

For example, a child sees a dog, recognizes it as a dog she has seen before,
identifies it as Fido, and categorizes it as a dog.

Recognition, identification, and categorization appear to be central to
perceptual and cognitive functioning, and they appear to entail the same
fundamental processes.

Pattern recognition is fundamental in such different domains as playing chess,
examining X-rays, and reading.

Computational models
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A model is a specific form of a theory.

Computational usually refers to systems that perform specific operations or
computations, such as computers.

However, a computational model is not necessarily a computer model, but might
consist of a set of operations that are described in quantitative form, which is
the case for most of the models discussed in this chapter.

The value of a computational model is that it can make precise predictions that
can be compared with human performance.

Approaches to pattern recognition

Template matching
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See: `Template matching`_

Feature analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the limitations of `template matching`_, psychologists have turned to
`feature analysis`_ as an alternative description of `pattern recognition`_.

.. Examples are listed.

.. aside

Although we experience a patter as integral whole, the work in AI, linguistic,
and neurophysiology encouraged psychologists to develop features
