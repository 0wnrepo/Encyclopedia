Background

Summary
================================================================================

Euthyphro encounters Socrates_ on the porch of the `King Archon`. They are both
there for preliminary hearings before possible trials. Socrates informs
Euthyphro that he is there because Meleteus has indicted him with corrupting the
youth through inventing new gods and denying the existence of old ones.
Euthyphro informs Socrates that he is there because he is pursuing his father
for manslaughter. Socrates supposes that Euthyphro's father must have killed a
relative, but Euthyphro explains that he has killed a servant, and that
Euthyphro is pursuing against his relatives wishes because he believes his
father was unjust in doing so. Socrates is surprised to hear this, and questions
if Euthyphro knows what it means to be pious and impious so exactly that he
is sure he isn't wrong in persecuting his father. Euthyphro seems to be very
confident, and claims his knowledge is (it seems he is a theologian). As
Socrates is charged with impiety, he expresses to Euthyphro that he wishes to
become his disciple and begins asking about piety and impiety.

First definition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socrates begins by confirming that there is exactly one piety and then asks what
it is. Euthyphro answers indirectly, saying his persecution of his father is
pious, and that not doing so would be impious. [1]_ Socrates rejects this
though, stating that he did not ask for examples, and instead asked for "the
general idea which makes all pious things to be pious," "a standard to which I
may look, and by which I may measure actions, whether yours or of any one else,
and then I shall be able to say that such and such an action is pious, and such
another impious."

Second definition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Euthyphro claims:

1. Piety is that which is beloved to the gods, and impiety is that which is not
   beloved to them.

Socrates wants to figure out whether that definition is true and begins
establishing a number of propositions.

2. The gods quarrel.

3. Men quarrel if and only if they differ on matters that cannot be decided
   objectively.
   
4. What is good and evil (good and evil, honorable and dishonorable) cannot be
   decided objectively.

5. Men quarrel if and only if they differ on what is good and evil. (3, 4)

6. The quarrels between men and gods are of a similar nature.

7. The gods differ on what is good and evil. (2, 5, 6)

8. The gods deem some things good and some things evil. (~7)

9. Some things are both deemed good by some gods and deemed evil by other gods.
   (7, ~8)
   
10. The gods love that which they deem good, and hate that which they deem evil.

11. Some things are both beloved by some gods and hated by other gods. (9, 10)

12. Some things are both pious and impious. (1, 11) [contradiction]

Euthyphro remarks:

13. Some things are only pious or only impious.

14. Men and gods agree evil-doers should be punished.

15. Men and gods quarrel about the particulars of who the evil-doer is, and what
    he did, and when. (14)

Euthyphro claims that it would be hard to explain to Socrates that he is right,
but Socrates points out it is unimportant, because even if he could be
convinced, he would not learn anything about what is piety is from doing so.

Euthyphro's dilemma
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socrates amend the definition.

1. What all the gods hate is impious and what they all love is pious and what
   some of them love and other is hate is both or neither.

Socrates then asks whether:

a. If some thing is pious, then it is beloved by the gods.

b. If some thing is beloved by the gods, then it is pious.

To make this distinction clear, Socrates explains the distinction between an
attribute and a thing's state by giving several examples:

- A thing is visible because it seen, not seen because it visible.

- A thing is being led because it is led, not led because it is being led.

- A thing is being carried because it is carried, not carried because it is
  being carried.

- A thing is in a state of suffering because it suffers, not suffers because it
  is in a state of suffering

- Generally, a thing is in a state of becoming because it becomes, not become
  because it is becoming

- A thing is beloved because it is loved, not loved because it is beloved.

2. A thing is pious because it is loved by all the gods.

3. A thing is loved by the all the gods because it is pious.

- That which is pious is the same with that which the gods love
- The gods love the pious because it is pious
- That which the gods love would have been loved because it is loved by the gods
  
but if that which is beloved to
the gods would have been loved as being beloved to the gods, then that which is
pious 

(forall x (if (holy x) (dear_to_god x)))
(forall x (if (holy x) (loved x)))
(forall x ((dear_to_god x) 


If that which is holy is the same with that which is dear to God, and is loved
because it is holy, then that which is dear to God would have been loved as
being dear to God.

But if that which dear to God is dear to him because loved by him, then that
which is holy would have been holy because loved by him.

Fourth definition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. That which is pious is necessarily just, but that which is just is not
   necessarily pious.

2. Piety is that part of justice which attends to the gods, as there is the
   other part of justice which attends to men.

3. Attention is always designed for the good or benefit of that to which the
   attention is given.

4. 

Final definition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Piety is the art of pleasing the gods in word and deed, by prayers and
   sacrifices.

2. Sacrificing is giving to the gods.

3. Prayer is asking of the gods.

4. Men prefer requests.

5. The right way of asking to ask of the gods what we want.

6. The right way of giving is to give to them in return what they want of us.

7. Piety is an art which gods and men have of doing business with one another.

8. There is no good thing which they gods do not given.

9. The gifts men give to the gods are tributes of honor.

10. Piety is beloved to the gods.


Meleteus is the deme of Pitthis.

.. [1]
    Euthyphro believes so because he claims is it common that Zeus is the most
    righteous of the gods and Zeus bound his father (Cronos) because he wickedly
    devoured his sons, and Cronos had punished his own father (Uranus) for a
    similar reason. Socrates confirms with Euthyphro that the gods exists and
    the tales are true.
