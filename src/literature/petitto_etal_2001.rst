:Abstract:
    There are two divergent hypotheses concerning the types of knowledge
    underlying early bilingualism.

    1. `Unitary language system`_: bilingualism is a troubled course marred by
       language delays and confusion
    2. `Differentiated language system`_: bilingualism is largely unremarkable

    This paper examines these hypotheses.

    Study:

    - bilingual children acquiring two spoken languages
    - bilingual children acquiring spoken and signed language

    Goal: shed new light on early bilingualism by clarifying maturational time
    course and nature of early bilingual language acquisition

    Results revealed that both groups:
    
    - achieved their early linguistic milestones at the same time
    - produced a substantial number of semantically corresponding words in
      each of their two languages from their very first words or signs
    - demonstrated sensitivity to the interlocutor's language by altering
      their language choices

    Propensity to mix language was directly related to parent's mixing rates.

    Conclude: the capacity to differentiate between two languages is well in
    place prior to first words.
    Hypothesis: this capacity may result from biological mechanisms that
    permits the discovery of early phonological representations

Introduction
============

Issues
------

- 


Theories
--------

Two hypotheses that reflect a different side of `bilingual paradox`_ exist:

#.  `Unitary language system`_
#.  `Differentiated language system`_

Unitary language system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The unitary language system asserts that children exposed to two languages
begin with a single fused linguistic representation and only at a certain age
do they begin to differentiate their native languages.

Predictions
"""""""""""

- the timing of the achievement of linguistic milestones in each of
  a bilingual baby's two languages should be different if the neural
  mechanism underlying human language acquisition are initially set to
  one language and similar if they are not
- other higher cognitive disruptions in the form of young bilingual's
  inability to differentiate between their two early lexicons
- according to Eve Clark's (1987) `principle of contrast`, monolingual
  children reject the acquisition of synonyms because they are biased
  toward acquiring a single named for each item in the world. If
  young bilinguals have a single fused, they should reject the
  acquisition of `translation equivalents`_ because they would view words for
  the same thing in different languages as being synonyms in the same language.

alternative hypothesis:

- infant brains may have dedicated neural mechanisms to detect highly
  particular patterns in the input relevant to natural language
  structure and these same mechanisms may be recruited - if bilingual
  exposure is early - thereby permitting the establishment of dual or
  or multiple language representations right from the start

1.  Voletrra & Taeschener 1978 showed very young bilinguals in the one-word
    stage have few semantically corresponding words across their two languages

    **example** if a child has the word 'ball' in one language, they do not have
    it in the other

    suggests young bilinguals do not initially differentiate between native
    vocabularies


2.  children around age 2;0 and beyond frequently mix words from both
    languages in rudimentary sentences

    predictions:

    - ability to differentiate words in their earliest lexicons

Differentiated language system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The differentiated language system assert that ...

-   does not deny that bilingual children mix elements of their languages in
    conversations, but suggest that the language mixing exhibits regular
    grammatical patterns and is directly influenced by sociolinguistic
    factors

    **example** children's language mixing is sensitive to the specific
    language used by the adults around them, as well as to their parent's
    patterns and degree of language mixing

    Language mixing does not reflect confusion, but instead demonstrates the
    bilingual child's distinct representation of their two input languages
    from an early age

    when such language differentiation occurs has not yet been answered

1. Pearson et al, 1995 found that 30% of children's early vocabulary consisted
   of translations equivalents.
2.  Previous research by Petitto it was found that in deaf children,
    milestones for bilingual and monolingual children were hit at the same
    time.

----

Recently two types of studies have provided crucial development facts
regarding the impact of very early bilingual language exosure on infants and
young children. These include studies of the young bilingual's:

1.  timing_ of the achievement of early linguistic milestones

    - provides insight into the issue of possible developmental language
      delay

2.  early lexical knowledge in each of the languages being acquired

    - provides insight into the issue of possible representational confusion

Both sets of studies provide insights into the key question of when language
differentiation begins.

1.  Studies of maturational timing that a bilingual infant's two languages
    follow have provided critical data to evaluate the above two classes of
    hypotheses in terms of their implicit assumptions about biology versus
    sociolinguistic (environmental) factors underlying childhood bilingualism.

    timing is a central construct in developmental biology and its importance
    as an index of biologically controlled processes has been understood for
    decades.

    example: in early monolingual language development, social-environmental
    input factors are understood to have a robust impact on the frequency of
    young children's vocabulary items, but not on the age at which they hit
    universal linguistic milestones; young children's vocabulary is thought
    to be highly amenable to environmental variation, but the achievement of
    certain grammatical word types and other grammatical and syntactic
    knowledge is more determined by biological regulation


2. Studies involving close examination of children's first words in each of
   their languages.

   Provides unique insight into young bilinguals' early semantic and conceptual
   knowledge.

.. _`bilingual paradox`:

Bilingual paradox
    Children can effortlessly acquire two or more languages, but early
    bilingual language exposure causes a trouble course of early language
    acquisition.

    There is widespread worry that early bilingual exposure may cause language
    delay or reduced competence. This is reflected in contemporary educational
    policies, where second language exposure happens well after toddler years.

.. _`translation equivalent`:
.. _`translation equivalents`:

Translation equivalent
    A cross-language synonym

.. _`timing`:

Timing
    regularity in the rate and nature by which specific behaviors or
    processes are expressed in the development of an organism
