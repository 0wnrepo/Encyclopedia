:Abstract:
    In this paper, `Elman`_ and `McClelland`_...

    An important question in `language processing`_ is whether |hl| |ps| are
    able to interact directly with |ll| |ps|, as assumed by interactive
    models such as the `TRACE`_ model of |sp|_.

    The issue is addressed in the present study by examining whether putative
    |ter| phenomena can trigger the operation of |tra| |ps| at |ll|.

    The |tra| |p| involved the |pc|_ for the |ci|_ of one speech sound on
    another.

    `TRACE`_ predicts that |pc|_ can be triggered by illusory phonemes which are
    perceived as a result of |td|, lexical influences.

Introduction
================================================================================
:Pages: 143-144

What is the degree to which cognitive |ps| are modular?

The issue has been of great interest and controversy and a difficult one to
decide because there is considerable overlap in the predictions made by the two
accounts: the `interactive view`_ and the `modular view`_. [#]_ [#]_

In this paper we:

#. Describe `TRACE`_.

#. Describe `a technique` which provides a rigorous test of the existence of
   true |td| interactions in processing.

#. Using this technique, we find that |hl| contextual factors can trigger
   compensatory |ps| that are basic to |sp|_.
   
#. These findings demonstrate that more effect of |hl| knowledge of |PER| is
   possible than has been thought.


How can |ci|_ be used to test the assumption of `TRACE`_ that |hl| do indeed
feed activation back to |ll|.?

    1. `Language comprehension` appears to involve the parallel processing of
       information at the semantic, syntactic, and phonological levels.

    2. This processing seems to be not only parallel but interactive; processing
       at each level appears to influence, and be influenced by, processing at
       other levels.

    3. Lexical information appears to play an active role in the |PER| of
       phonemes.

    4. The perceptual boundary between phonemes can be shifted as a function of
       lexical content.

    1. ?

    2. It is plausible that frequent sequences of events would result in stronger
       intramodule associations for these sequences.

.. [*]
    The answer will be relevant when we consider how one might test the
    assumption that influences really do feed back down from higher levels
    within the speech processing system.

.. _unit:

.. _modular view:
.. _autonomous view:
.. _autonomous model:

Modular view (or autonomous view)
    The view that cognitive processing of |PER| is essentially modular in
    nature.

    Claims:

    - Processing is autonomous.

    - |bu| |ps| make their output available to |hl| |ps|
      
    - |hl| |ps| do not affect |bu| |ps|

.. _interactive view:

Interactive view:
    The view that the cognitive processing of |PER| permits free flow of
    information.

    Claims:

    - |td| as well as |bu| interactions are possible.
