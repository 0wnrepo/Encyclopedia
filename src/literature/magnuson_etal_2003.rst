:Abstract:
    When and how is |bu| input integrated with |td| knowledge?

    The question has been debated extensively within cognition and perception
    and particularly within language processing.

    A long running debate about the picture of the speech recognition system has
    centered on the locus of lexical effects on phonemic processing: does
    lexical knowledge influence phoneme |PER| through feedback, or
    post-perceptually in a purely feedforward system?

    `Elman and McClelland (1988)`_ reported that lexically restored ambiguous
    phonemes influenced the perception of the following phoneme, supporting
    models with feedback from lexical to phonemic representations.
