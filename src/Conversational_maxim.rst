Conversational Maxim
================================================================================

A conversational maxim is a rule of etiquette for conversation_.

Grice offered four maxims (echoing Kant):

1. **Maxim of Quantity**
    1. Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purpose of the exchange)
    2. Do not make your contribution more informative than is required
2. **Maxim of Quality**
    0. Try to make your contribution one that is true. (necessary for other maxims)
    1. Do not say what you believe to be false
    2. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence
3. **Maxim of Relation (Relevance)**
    1. Be relevant.
4. **Maxim of Manner**
    0. Be perspicuous.
    1. Avoid obscurity of expression
    2. Avoid ambiguity
    3. Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity)
    4. Be orderly

The observance of some of these maxims is a matter of less urgency than the observance of others.[10]

    * Prolixity is less evil than false

Note: Many other maxims exist. (e.g. aesthetic, social, moral (e.g. be polite))
