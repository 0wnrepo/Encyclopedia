Feedback
================================================================================

Feedback is the transmission of the receiver's reaction back to the sender.[2]

Feedback enables the speaker to adjust his or her performance to the needs and response of an audience.[2]

Good speakers are generally sensitive to feedback and vice-versa.[2]

Some channels of communication make feedback very difficult.[2]

Example: two-way radio
Example: telephones

The feedback ability of a channel_ is determined mainly by availability of
channels.[2]

:Example:
    In face-to-face communication, I can transmit with my voice and receive with
    my eyes

Another factor is access to these channels.[2]

Example: Mechanical media, particular the mass media, limit access and therefore limit feedback
Example: In a lecture, students are unable to use the channel of sound, so they give less feedback than in a seminar

Feedback has the primary function of helping the communicator adjust his or her message to the need and response of the receiver.[2]

Feedback has a number of secondary functions:[2]

- Helps the receiver feel involved in the communication (being aware makes us more likely to accept the message; being unable to express our response can lead to frustration that causes noise) 

Though feedback inserts a return loop from destination to source, it does not destroy the linearity of the model.

Feedback makes the process of transmitting messages more efficient.
