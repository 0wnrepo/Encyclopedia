================================================================================
Speech Act
================================================================================

A speech act is a `communicative act`_.

A speech act (or linguistic act or language act) is a production of a sentence
token under certain conditions.[2]

Speech acts are the basic or minimal units of linguistic communication.[2] All linguistic communication involves linguistic acts.[2] Speaking a language is performing speech acts.[2]

Most of the world's language have separate syntactic constructions that distinguish speech acts. Other speech acts do not have a syntactic construction specific to them.

    *   `If you X, I'll Y.` can express either a threat, a promise, or causal relation.

### Direct Act

A communicative act is direct iff its speaker meaning is identical to its sentence meaning.[2]

    *   "What is your name?"

### Indirect Act

A communicative act is indirect iff it is not direct.[2]

  *   "Peter, can you open the window?" instead of "Peter, open the window."
  *   "If you pass the guacamole that would be awesome." (polite request)[7]
  *   A: "Let's go to the movies tonight."
      B: "I have to study for an exam."[2]
  *   Consider: "Do you know if Jenny got an A on the test?"

        This is probably not an inquiry about what you know.

        The normal answer we would expect would be something like:

        - "Yes, she did."
        - "No, she only got a B"

        The reply is direct to the speech act meaning, not the literal meaning.

        A simple "yes" might be interpreted as being uncooperative.
  *   Hints[2]
  *   Irony[2]
  *   Metaphor[2]

In indirect acts, the sender communicates to receiver by way of relying on:[2]

1. Mutually shared background information
2. The general powers of rationality and inference on the part of the hearer

Indirect speech is inefficient.[7]
Indirect speech is vulnerable to being misunderstood.[7]
Indirect speech appears to be nearly universal.[7]

Speakers use indirect speech when the relational model assumed by the speech act clashes with the model that currently holds between the speaker and hearer to avoid the risk of awkwardness or shame.[3]

    * A writer feels uneasy bribing a maitre d' because whereas the relationship assumed by a maitre d' toward diners is one of of authority ranking, according to which he seats diners when and where he pleases, the writer was proposing a reciprocity transaction appropriate to equality matching, according to which the maitre d' would obligated to seat him in exchange for the bribe.[3]


#### On-record indirect act

An indirect act is on-record if is has become so conventionalized that hearers rarely perceive the liter meaning.

    *   "Can you reach the salt?" for "Pass the salt."[2]

#### Off-record indirect act

An indirect act is off-record if it is not on-record.

    * Threats
        * "I hear you're the foreman of the jury in the Soprano trial. It's an important civic responsibility. You have a wife and kids. We know you'll do the right thing."
        * "Nice store you got there. Would be a real shame if something happened to it." (threat)[7]
    * Bribes
        * "Gee, officer. I was thinking that maybe the best thing would be to take care of the ticket here, without going through a lot of paperwork."
    * Sexual Advanced
        * "Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"
    * Solicitation
        * "We're counting on you to show leadership in our Camping for the Future."

`Cooperation theories`_ are not very successful in explaining certain aspects of off-record indirect speech.[3]

1. Off-record indirect speech is often accompanied by significant interpersonal conflict.[3]
    - Bribes, threats, sexual advances are unlikely to be clad in constructions that protect the hearer's face ("Please", "Do you think you might", "I'm sorry to have to ask but")
2. Empirically, off-record indirect speech are not always maximally polite.
    - Raters often deem off-record indirect speech acts to be less polite than negative politeness and sometimes as downright rude ("Didn't I already ask you to empty the dishwasher?")
3. Empirically, positive and negative politeness and the fact threats that call for them have been found to differ not just in degree but also in kind.
    * If, following Alan's offer of sherry to Barbara at a dinner party, she were to attempt to restore equity by offering to pay him for the drink, or if he were to ask her return the favor is the form of a sexual kiss, the exchange would result not in a reduction of emotional tension but an elevation, experienced as puzzlement, awkwardness, or shock.

The limitations of traditional cooperation theories in explaining off-record indirect speech acts may be remedied by two insights from evolutionary biology:

1. Social relationships among conspecifics never involve a perfect overlap of interests (and hence full operation) but always entail at least a partial conflict of interest.
    - This in turn affects their mode of communication in ways that may excepted to flout the cooperative principle. Animal signals are often attempt to manipulate the behavior of receivers to the signaler's advantage. At equilibrium under natural selection, both signaler and receiver benefit from the exchange; otherwise the signaling system would cease to exist. Therefore, we expect a longstanding system of communication among living things to reflect a complex mixture of cooperation and conflict.
2. Relationships among conspecifics are expected to fall into discrete kinds, in which the dyads follow qualitatively different set of strategies depending on their genetic relationship, history, sex, and relative strength.
    - Includes dominance, mutualism, parenting, reciprocal altruism, short-term mating, and long-term pair bonding
    - Relational models theory (relationship-specific social psychology) is the hypothesis that humans differentiate their relationships into different kinds.
    - A speech act may not fit along a single continuum; it may involve uncertainty over which of several possible models of relationship should be in force, each prescribing a different degree and kind of cooperation.

Strategic Speaker Theory: Off-record indirect speech can explained in terms of the strategies of speakers in identification problems (negotiating relationship types under conditions of uncertainty).[3] Rather than presupposing full cooperation, the theory posits that indirect speech is deployed to negotiate whether and what kind of cooperation should be in effect between them.

The logic of this theory -- that indirect speech supplies plausible tenability in identification problems  --is most easily explained with scenarios in which the speaker's expected costs and benefits can be quantified.[3]

    * Consider a motorist detained by a police offer contemplating a bribe to evade a traffic ticket.

Note: The game-theoretic model (also) applies to purely social situations whether there may no legal risks or quantifiable incentives.[3]

Strategic speaker theory, when extended to higher orders of deniability, can explain why indirect speech is used even when there is little uncertainty in the speaker's intent or the hearer's values regarding the relationship switch.[3] The theory explains why a thinly disguised request that fools no one is still more socially acceptable than the same request expressed baldy.

Puzzles:

1. Plausible deniability.
2. Why do people use indirect speech in nonlegal situations, where there are no financial or legal payoffs and penalties?
3. People use indirect speech even when the degree of uncertainty about the other's intentions is low--either because variance among listeners values is low (so speaker's confidence in their values is high), or because the listener is astute enough to understand the intent of a speaker's innuendo with high confidence. Why, in such cases, is a thinly veiled proposition still more acceptance than a naked one?

Plausible Deniability as a Solution to the Identification Problem
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*   Consider a motorist who has been pulled over for speeding and is considering two options:
    1. Accepting the ticket
    2. Offering a bribe to the police officer

    Which offers the better expected payoff depends on the values of the officer he is facing.

    (2) is a criminal offense which is punished more harshly than a traffic violation.

    If the officer is honest, then (2) leads to a more severe penalty than (1).

    Identification problem: Two type of hearers:

        1. Cooperators
        2. Antagonist

    An attempted initiation of a joint endeavor with an antagonist will backfire to result in the worst possible outcome.

    The speaker cannot tell the two types apart.

    If the motorist were constrained to the cooperative principle, he would offer the bribe in direct speech.
    
    Suppose the motorist is allow to deviated by veiling the bribe in an obscure, ambiguous, or irrelevant comment.
    Suppose a dishonest officer can detect the bribe in the innuendo using mechanisms of implicature.
    Suppose an honest officer hearing the same sound could not make a bribery charge stick in court by the high standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
    Then, the indirect speech act may allow the driver to combine the large benefit of bribing a dishonest officer with the relatively small cost of submitting to an honest one.

    See table below:

    Indirectness is not always advantageous; it is only so far with particular payoffs.

    Let:
        y   = the expectation of the cost borne by the driver
        q   = the proportion of officers who antagonists
        c0  = the cost of the bribe
        c1  = the cost of the ticket (c1 > c0)
        c2  = the cost of arrest for bribery (c2 > c1)
        d   = the directness of the statement; reflects the number of inferential steps that must be carried out in the implicature to get from the literal content of the sentence to the meaning intended by the speaker; corresponds to the decision-theoretic variable of the probability that a signal reflects one state of affairs or another.
        p   = the probability that an officer will interpret driver's statement as an attempted bribe and act accordingly (accepting the bribe or arresting the driver) (increases monotonically with d)

    If antagonists and cooperators uses the same decision function when acting on a statement, indirect speech is never optimal.

    If `q > (c1 - c0) / (c2 - c0)` the optimal strategy for the driver is not attempt a bribe at all.

    q * (c2 - c0) > c1 - c0
    q * c2 - q * c0 > c1 - c0
    q * c2 > c1 - c0 + q * c0
    q * c2 > c1 - c0 * (1 - q)
    q * c2 + (1 - q) * c0 > c1

    If `q < (c1 - c0) / (c2 - c0)` the optimal strategy for the driver is to bribe directly.

    Indirect speech is optimal in some cases when the two types of hearer different in their probability of responding to the speaker's first move.

    Consider a cooperator must be 80% certain that P1 offered a bribe before he acts. Now, if an antagonist must meet an even higher threshold (say 99%) before he acts, a rational driver should pitch his utterance at a directness level intended to induce a level of certainty in the hear somewhere between 90% and 99%.

    Assumption: Over some range of directness, an antagonist sets a higher threshold than one who is completely cooperative for action.

The SS theory's central concept of deniability is related, but not identical, to the concept of defeasability in the linguistic literature on implicature.

An implicature is defeasible if it not logically entailed by the utterance and be canceled or suspended without contradiction.

    * "Some men are chauvinists." leads listeners to infer that the speakers also means that some men are not chauvinists. But that implicature is not logically entailed and be canceled: "Some men are chauvinists; indeed, all are."
    * "They got married and had a baby, but not in that order."

Deniability requires defeasability, but defeasability does not require deniability.[3]

Defeasability is exploited purely for rhetorical purposes.[3]

Plausible deniability is also distinct from the maxim "provide option" in theories of politeness, which underlies a range of constructions of deferential politeness such as "if you please" and "do you think you might".[3] The maxim is intended to ease the face threat of a request directed to a cooperative hearer, with no strategic consequences; it is not a strategy designed to protect the interests of the speaker when addressing a potentially antagonists hearer.[3]

The model of a SS has testable implications:

1. The indirectness of speech should be perceived not just as a social gesture that redresses the hearer's face but as one that monotonically affects his interpretation and decision; people should sense that the abstract linguistic variable of directness, which underlies an unlimited range of wording, corresponds to the hearer's probability of action, and they should deploy that correspondence strategically, so as to minimize their quantifiable costs according to the payoff matrix implicit in the situation.[3] Directness should vary when the fact-threat variables are held constant. If speakers calibrate directness only to face threat, not to payoffs and probability, it would undermine the hypothesis that indirectness is deployed strategically in cases where cooperation is uncertain.
2. When speakers do favor indirect speech, they should perceive that cooperative hearers have lower thresholds of action along the directness continuum than uncooperative hearers. If there is no such difference, then strategic speaker would clearly be falsified, because it is only under those circumstances that indirect speech is optimal.[3]

Directness is a semantic variable that corresponds to the degree of vagueness of the proposition.[7]

The study confirms two predictions of the strategic speaker model:

1. The choice of directness in speech is affected not just by the traditional variables of power, status, and imposition, but my payoff structure inherent in the different possible interpretations and actions of the hearer.
2. People assume that the threshold for the appropriate action set by an antagonistic hearer to be higher than the one set by a cooperative hearer.

When conditions favored a bald proposition, participants often did not conform to the seemingly rational response of placing their entire probability mass on the most direct speech act, but rather opted to be relatively vague. This bia is not attributable to experimental noise or a tendency of the participants to avoid extreme responses When the payoff militated toward the opposite extreme and ruled out an attempted bribe entirely, responses were bunched more tightly at the vague end of the scale. Nothing in the model predicts this asymmetry. Particiapnts must have felt that there is emotional cost incurrend in a botched encounter with a police offer over and above any state-enforced penalties.

### Locutionary act

A locutionary act is a signaling act; the utterance itself.

A locutionary act may be phonetic, phatic, or rhetic.[1]

### Illocutionary Act

An illocutionary act is a communicative act by which a sender means something.[1]

    * Paul is asking Jean to sit down in saying "Please sit down" to Jean.
    * Telling
    * Asking
    * Warning
    * Ordering
    * Offering
    * Thanking
    * Congratulating
    * Appointing
    * Firing

An illocutionary act is successful if the receiver recognizes the sender's intent.

An illocutionary act consists of:

1. An illocutionary point

### Illocutionary Point

An illocutionary point is the primary publicly intended perlocutionary effect of a illocutionary act.[1]

    * The illocutionary point of a request is to get the addressee to do something.

Verschueren (1980) counted more than 150 illocutionary verbs in English.[1]

Illocutionary acts differ principally in their illocutionary point.[2]

Searle divided locutionary points into five main categories:[1]

1. Assertive
2. Directive
3. Commissive
4. Expressive
5. Declaration

Note: An illocutionary point may belong to more than one category. Categories are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive. Nevertheless classification has heuristic value.

    * The order of a general or police offer is both a directive and a declaration.

Assertive
---------

An assertive is a direct illocutionary speech act that gets addressees to form or attend to the belief that the speaker is committed to a certain belief.

    *   When Paul tells Jean "I'm tired" he is trying to get her to accept the belief that he is tired.
    *   "Jenny got an A on the test."

Subclasses:

- Prediction
- Notifications
- Confessions
- Denials
- Retorts
- Conjectures
- Suppositions

Assertives seem to be universal.

### Directive

A directive is a direct illocutionary act that causes addresses to act to make a proposition true.

    *   "Get an A on the test."
    *   When Paul asks Jean to sit down, he is trying to get her to do something: to sit down.

#### Linguistic Directive

A request for linguistic action is ...

    * Questions ("What time is it?")

A question elicits information.

    *   "Did you get an A on the test?"

A question is a kind of interrogative sentence.

#### Non-linguistic Directive

A request for nonlinguistic action is ...

    * Commands
    * Suggestions
    *   "Get an A on the test."

Directives range in force.

    * Mild hint
    * Command

### Commissive

A commissive commits the speaker to some future action.

    * When Paul says to Jean "I'll be there in a minute" he is committing himself to being there is a minute.

The most common commissive is the promise.

A promise can be absolute or conditional.

A conditional promise is an offer.

    * When Paul says to Jean, "Can I get you a beer?" he is committing himself to getting Jean a beer, but only if she wants one.

### Expressive

An expressive expresses certain psychological feelings toward the addressees.

    * When Paul steps on Jean's foot by mistake, he says, "Sorry." In doing so, he presupposes that he caused Jean some harm and tries to get her to recognize his regret in having done so.

Includes:

- Thanking
- Greeting
- Congratulating
- Apologizing
- Well-wishing

### Declaration

A declaration effects an institutional state of affairs.

Declarations take place within institutions.

Includes:

- Boss can appoint, promote, fire.
- Employee can quit.
- Judge can indict, pardon, sentence.
- Referees starting a game, calling fouls, calling time-outs.
- Police offer arresting people.
- Priest baptizing, marrying, blessing people.

A speaker must perform a declaration with proper institutional authority, else it is defective, null and void.

### Perlocutionary Act

A perlocutionary act is a communicative act by which a sender affects the receiver.

    * Paul is doing something by asking Jean to sit down: getting her to sit down.
    * Convincing
    * Persuading
    * Deceiving
    * Irritating
    * Encouraging
    * Frightening
    * Amusing
    * Impressing
    * Boring

A perlocutionary act is successful if some effect is realized in the receiver. A perlocutionary may fail even if the receiver recognizes the sender's intent.

A perlocutionary effect (or perlocution) is any effect on addressees that is caused by their understanding of what a speaker meant.[1]

Perlocutions may either be intended or unintended.[1]

    * When Paul warns Jean "There's a bicycle coming up behind you", he may intend to frighten her so she will jump out of the way. If she believe him, she may become frightened and jump, and if she does not, she will not jump. (intended)
    * When Paul tells Jean, "It's six o'clock" he may intend for her to learn what time it is, but he may not realize she will be upset because she just missed her train. (unintended)

One perlocution has a privileged status and it is the primary point of the illocutionary act.[1]

    * When Cathy asks Betty, "Who is it?", the primary intended perlocution (the primary thing she is trying to get Betty to do) is to tell her who is on the telephone.

### Performative

A performative is a direct speech act that use performative verbs to accomplish its end.

    *   "I assert that Jenny got an A on the test."
    *   "I ask you, Jenny, to get an A on the test."
    *   "I order you, Jenny, to get an A on the test."

Performatives allow us to expand the kind of direct speech act beyond the three basic types that have their own special syntax.

A test of whether or not a particular sentence is a performative sentence is whether or not you can insert 'hereby'  before the verb.

    *   "I hereby name this Sojourner", True
    *   "I hereby named this Sojourner", False
