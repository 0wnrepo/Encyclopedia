Who's the Subject? Sentence Structure and Verb Meaning
================================================================================

Very young children use the syntax of sentences to interpret new words. In many
experiments children between ages 2-5 assigned different interpretations to
made-up verbs depending on the sentence in which the verb was presented. Such
findings tell us that observed events are not the only influence on verb
interpretation even for very young children; sentence structure provides useful
cues as well.

Syntactic bootstrapping is the proposal that sensitivity to sentence structure
guides the acquisition of verb meaning.

- How could syntactic bootstrapping work?

- What aspects of sentence structures are informative to young children, and
  what semantic information is conveyed to young children by the structure of
  sentences?

The meaning conveyed by a sentence structure must necessarily be very abstract.

*   The sentences below are all transitive yet contain verbs differing greatly
    in their meanings.
    
    1. Emma kicked John. [action of an object]

    2. Emma saw John. [perception]

    3. The conversation justified all their hopes. [abstract causation]

    4. John's sincerity pleased Emma. [abstract causation]

Sentence structures vary principally in the number and type of arguments and the
positioning or marking of those arguments. Therefore, sentence structure yields
information about aspect's of a verb's meaning that affect the number.

Can this information be used in principled and in practice, in interpreting
sentences with unknown verbs? To answer this, we need to ask, essentially, what
it means to be the subject of a sentence.
