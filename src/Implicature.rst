================================================================================
Implicature
================================================================================

An implicature is anything that is inferred from an utterance_ but that is not a
condition for its truth; an implicature is what is meant (but not necessarily
said).

  * The expression "Some of the boys were at the party" implicates in most contexts, "Not all the boys were at the party."

An implication is ... (what is implied)

To implicate is to...

Suppose:
    - A and B are talking about a mutual friend C who is now working in a bank
    - A asks B how C is getting on his job
    - B replies "Oh quite well, I think; he likes his collages, and he hasn't been to prison yet"
    - A might inquire what B was implying by saying that C has not yet been to prison
        - B might say that
            - C is the sort of person likely to yield to the temptation provided by his occupation
            - C's collages are very unpleasant and treacherous
            - so forth
    - It might be unnecessary for A to ask B such a thing
        - It might be implied in the context clear in advance
    - Whatever B implied is distinct from what B said (that C had not been to prison)

### Conventional Implicature

A implicature is conventional if it implicates by the conventional meaning of the words used.

Conventional implicature is identical with sentence meaning. 

Conventional implicature is not inferred.

### Nonconventional Implicature

A nonconventional implicature is not conventionally associated with the words or sentence uttered.[1]

    * "There is a garage around the corner" does not conventionally mean that the garage is open.

### Nonconversational implicature

A nonconversational implicature is a nonconventional implicature that arises from the operation of a principle or maxim other than the cooperative principle and conversational maxims.

Example: Implicature derived from the assumption of the informativeness principles

### Conversational Implicature

A conversational implicature is a nonconventional implicature.

    * B's implicature that the garage my be open and selling petrol.[1]

Conversational implicature is based on an addressee's assumption that the speaker is following the conversational maxims or at least the cooperative principle.

Properties:[1]

1. Calculable
2. Defeasible

(1) Calculable

Speakers intend addressees to be able to work out conversational implicatures.[1]

    * A is to work out that B means that he believes the garage may be open.

(2) Defeasible

Speakers can cancel conversational implicatures, rendering them null and void.[1]

    * "There is a garage round the corner, but I doubt if it's open" nullifies the implicature A would otherwise work out.

Speakers produce implicature in two main ways:[1]

1. Direct appeal to maxims
2. Blatantly violating (flouting) a maxim (leads to rhetorical figures)

- Remarks on "say":
    - By say Grice intends the sentence meaning
        Suppose someone uttered: "He is in the grip of a vice"
            - without knowledge of the circumstances
                - one would know nothing about what the speaker said assuming he was speaking English and literally
                - one would know that that
                    - he he said about some particular male person or animal, x, that
                        - at the time of the utterance either
                            1 x was unable to rid himself of a certain bad character trait, or
                            2 some part of x was caught in a certain kind of tool
                - for a full identification one would need to know
                    - the identity of x
                    - the time of the utterance
                    - the meaning on the particular occasion of utterance of the phrase "the grip of a vice" (either 1 or 2)
    - Grice's use of say leaves it open whether
         - a man who says (today)- "Harold Wilson is a great man"  and
         - another who say, "The British Prime Minstier is a great man"
         - would if each knew the terms had the same reference had said the same thing
    - regardless
        - the appartus Grice is about to provide will be capable of accounting for any implicates that might depend on the presence of one rather than another of these singlar terms in the sentence uttered
    - such implicatures would merely be related to different maxims

- in some cases
    - the conventional meaning of the words used will determined what is implicated
        - besides helping to determine what is said
            Example: "he is an Englushman; he is, therefore, brave" I have commited myself by virtue of meaning of words to its being the case that being brave follows from being an English man
    - however, Grice does not want to say that I have SAID (in the favored sense) that it follows from his being an Englishman that he is brave, thought Grice implicated it is so
    - do not want to say that utterance of this sentence would be STRICTLY SPEAKING false, should the consequence in question fail to hold
    - SOME implicatures are conventional (unlike the vice one)
