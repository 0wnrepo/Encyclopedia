Word superiority effect
================================================================================

The **word superiority effect** (WSE) refers to the phenomenon that `letter
recognition`_ is better when letters are presented within words as compared to
when letters are isolated or presented within nonword (orthographically
illegal, unpronounceable letter array) strings; the perceptual advantage of |Ws|
over |-Ws| or |1Ls|.
