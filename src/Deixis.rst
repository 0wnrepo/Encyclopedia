Deixis
================================================================================

Deixis refers to words and phrases that cannot be fully understood without
additional context information.

A word is deictic if its semantic meaning is fixed but its denotational meaning
varies depending on the time or place.

Indexical
================================================================================

An indexical is a linguistic expression who's reference shifts from context to
context.

* "I"

* "today"

* "here"

Two speakers who utter a single sentence that contains an indexical may say
different things.

Indexical have two sorts of meaning:

1. "Character" or "Linguistic meaning"

2. "Content"

Motivation
================================================================================

1. Philosophers wish to describe their meaning and fit them into a more general
   theory of meaning

2. Philosophers wish to understand the logic of arguments containing indexicals
   (e.g. Descarte's "Cogito")

3. Philosophers think that reflection on indexicals may give them insight into
   some matters such as the nature of belief, self-knowledge, first-person
   perspective, and consciousness.

Kinds
================================================================================

Demonstrative
-------------

A name is demonstrative iff it indicates which entities the speaker refer to and
distinguishes those entities from others. For example, "this" or "that".

Possessive Name
---------------

A name is possessive iff ... 

Example: "My father"
Example: "Your ball"

Semantics of direct reference: theories of meaning according to which certain singular terms refer directly without the meditation of (Fregean) sense as meaning. If there are such terms then the proposition expressed by a sentence contains such a term would involve individuals directly rather by the way of the "individual concepts" or "manners of presentation" I had been taught to expect.

A term is a direct referential term iff ...

A proposition is singular if ...

- Even if English contained no such singular terms who proper semantics was one of direct reference, could we determine to introduce such terms?
- Even if we had no directly referential terms and introduced needs, is there a need or use of singular propositions?

A value for a variable is an individual drawn from the universe over which the variable is take to range.[1]

A variable's first and only meaning is it value.[1]

If we are to associate a proposition (not merely a truth-value) with a formula containing a free variable, that proposition seems bound to be singular.[1]
