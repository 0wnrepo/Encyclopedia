Building rapport
================================================================================

Dubious:

1.  Establish artificial time constraints.

    Nobody wants to feel trapped in an awkward conversation with a stranger.

    * "I'm on my way out but before I left I wanted to ask you..."

2.  Make sure your body language is in sync.

    Make sure your words and body language are aligned and both are non-threatening.

3.  Speak slowly.

    Quick speech indicates nervousness, not confidence.

4.  Ask for help.

    Small requests create connections to those who ask.

5.  Suspend your ego.

    Avoid correcting people or anything that could be interpreted as one-upping.

    Encourage the other person to keep telling their story. Avoid telling your own.

6.  Validate others.

    The simplest way to do this is to listen. Avoid interjecting thoughts.

7.  Ask open-ended questions.

8.  Quid pro quo ("this for that" or "favor for favor"). 

    Give a piece of personal information every time they reveal one to get a flow going.

9.  Give a gift.

10. Manage your own expectations

    Avoiding setting expectations that are bound to disappoint.

Behavioral change Stairway Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shows 5 steps to getting someone else to see your point of view and change what
they're doing. It applies to most any form of disagreement.

Developed by FBI hostage negotiation unit.

Five steps:

1.  Active listening

    Listen to their side and make them aware you're listening.

    1. Listen to what they say. Don't interrupt disagree or evaluate.
    2. Nod your head. Make brief acknowledging comments like "yes" and "uh-huh"
    3. Without being awkward, repeat back the gist of what they just said, from their frame of reference
    4. Inquire. Ask questions that show you've been paying attention and that move the discussion forward.

2.  Empathy

    You get an understanding of where they're coming from and how they feel.

3.  Rapport

    Rapport is when the other party feels empathy back. They start to trust you.

4.  Influence

    Now that they trust you, you've earned the right to work on the problem solving with them and recommend a course of action.

5.  Behavioral change

    They act.

Six techniques:

1.  Ask open-ended questions

    *   "Sounds like a tough deal. Tell me how it all happened."

        - Non-judgmental
        - Shows interest
        - Likely to lead to more information
    *   "Do you have a gun? What kind? How many bullets do you have?"

        - Forces one-word answers
        - Gives impression negotiator is more interested in gun than man
        - Communicates sense of urgency that builds (rather than defuses) tension

2.  Effective pauses

    Use it for emphasis, to encourage to someone to keep talking, or to defuse things when people get emotional.

3.  Minimal encourages

    Brief statements to let the person know you're listening and to keep them talking.

    * "yes", "ok", "i see"

4.  Mirroring.

    Repeat the last word or phrase the person said to show you're listening and engaged.

    *   Subject: "I'm sick and tired of being pushed around"
        Negotiator: "Feel pushed, huh?"

5.  Paraphrasing
    
    Repeat what the other person is saying back to them in your own words.

    Shows you really understand and aren't merely parroting.

6.  Emotional labeling

    Give their feelings a name.

    Don't comment on validity of feeling, btu show you understand.

    *   "You sound pretty hurt about being left. It doesn't seem fair."

        Recognizes feelings without judging them.

        Good Additive empathetic response. Identifities the hurt that underlies anger.
    *   "You don't need to feel that way. If he was messing around on you, he was not worth the energy."

        Poor repsonse.

        Judgmental. Tells the subject how not to feel. Minimizes subject's feeling which are a major part of who she is. Subtractive Empathy.

People love talking about themselves and enjoy the company of those who take a genuine interest in them.

By doing this (in the right way), you let her talk about herself, but you control what she is talking about. You don't want to hear about her personal problems (intellectual whore). You just jump in every once-in-a-while with a "me too" statement to let her know that you guys are connecting. You GUIDE the conversation completely. This puts you in control. When the conversation starts heading off track, you bring it back.

Take a genuine interest in what she's saying. Don't try to fake it. When she tells you she went to Europe for 3 months, don't say, "That's cool." That's a big thing. Ask her about it. What did she like? Where in Europe did she go? What were the people like? What differences are there between Europe and the US? You could talk to her for hours just about her trip.

Tips

1. Always be aware of your surroundings! 
    - Some of the best conversation starters are based on what's going on around you. Maybe something funny happened, maybe there's a guy that looks like Tom Hanks. Maybe the girl dropped her cell phone in water. Whatever is going on around you, learn to use it to your advantage. 
    - Ways to practice this: When you go out, look for things happening to people or in your surroundings. Then, approach anyone (guy or girl) and talk to him or her about it. Make it seem smooth and if you can, funny. Then, let that lead into more conversation. This is probably the best way to do a Cold Approach IMO.
2. Don't ask random questions! 
    - This isn't 20 questions. Don't ask a girl a question and then proceed by asking her a totally unrelated question when she answers. Keep the questions related to her answer. Base what you say off of her response. DON'T PLAN OUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY NEXT. Go with the flow. 
    - Good
        - Guy: Do you live around here? 
        - Girl: I actually live about 20 min away in __ 
        - Guy: Really? I hear they listen to quite a bit of rap in __ (just an example) 
        - Girl: Yeah they do! I'm not too big on rap though. I prefer acoustic bands like John Mayer or Dave Matthews 
        - Guy: Dave was just up at the Gorge for a concert last week. Did you see the concert? 
        - Girl: I really wanted to go but got stuck working the whole weekend 
        - Guy: etc etc 
    - Bad
        - Guy: Do you live around here? 
        - Girl: I actually live about 20 min away in __ 
        - Guy: Cool. What kind of music do you listen to? 
        - Girl: My favorite would have to be any acoustic bands 
        - Guy: Did you go to the Dave Matthews Concert? 
        - Girl: No, I got stuck working 
        - Guy: Where do you work? 
3. Keep the Conversations Positive 
    - There's nothing people hate more than a negative person. You know the type: Those people that complain and argue about EVERYTHING. Always try to avoid anything negative.
    - NEVER whine or complain and don't argue. 
4. Understand people have opinions where there is no right or wrong 
    - I've met so many people who always have to argue with people's opinions. That's just their way of thinking. Don't agree with a girl just for the sake of agreeing. If you have a difference of opinion, and think you can back it up, then let her know you disagree, but do it in an adult-like manner. Don't insult her way of thinking. Just like you, she probably has reasoning for her opinion. You could ask her what her reasoning is behind that. Throw in your point of view, but acknowledge her points. 
5. Noun-ing 
    - This is a technique I read about that will help those of you who have trouble with conversation. You'll be able to hold a conversation without a problem. It could start with the simplest of questions like, "What did you do today?" You'll learn to do this with practice without even thinking about it, but for now, here's how you do it. (this is taken from another post) 
    - Example
        - Guy: So what do you do with yourself? 
        - Girl: Oh, Im in Trinity College in Dublin studying Law. 
        - Take the nounf of this reply:
            - Trinity College
            - Dublin
            - Law
        - Pick any of these and ask a question about it!
6. Use Open-Ended Questions 
7. Men want facts; women want feelings
    - This of course is a generalization that I read somewhere: Men like to cut to the facts. They don't like all the small talk and stuff in between. Men organize thoughts in their head and then say what needs to be said. Women use talking as a means to organize their thoughts.
