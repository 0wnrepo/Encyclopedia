Building rapport
================================================================================

Dubious:

1.  Establish artificial time constraints.

    Nobody wants to feel trapped in an awkward conversation with a stranger.

    * "I'm on my way out but before I left I wanted to ask you..."

2.  Make sure your body language is in sync.

    Make sure your words and body language are aligned and both are non-threatening.

3.  Speak slowly.

    Quick speech indicates nervousness, not confidence.

4.  Ask for help.

    Small requests create connections to those who ask.

5.  Suspend your ego.

    Avoid correcting people or anything that could be interpreted as one-upping.

    Encourage the other person to keep telling their story. Avoid telling your own.

6.  Validate others.

    The simplest way to do this is to listen. Avoid interjecting thoughts.

7.  Ask open-ended questions.

8.  Quid pro quo ("this for that" or "favor for favor"). 

    Give a piece of personal information every time they reveal one to get a flow going.

9.  Give a gift.

10. Manage your own expectations

    Avoiding setting expectations that are bound to disappoint.

Behavioral change Stairway Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shows 5 steps to getting someone else to see your point of view and change what
they're doing. It applies to most any form of disagreement.

Developed by FBI hostage negotiation unit.

Five steps:

1.  Active listening

    Listen to their side and make them aware you're listening.

    1. Listen to what they say. Don't interrupt disagree or evaluate.
    2. Nod your head. Make brief acknowledging comments like "yes" and "uh-huh"
    3. Without being awkward, repeat back the gist of what they just said, from their frame of reference
    4. Inquire. Ask questions that show you've been paying attention and that move the discussion forward.

2.  Empathy

    You get an understanding of where they're coming from and how they feel.

3.  Rapport

    Rapport is when the other party feels empathy back. They start to trust you.

4.  Influence

    Now that they trust you, you've earned the right to work on the problem solving with them and recommend a course of action.

5.  Behavioral change

    They act.

Six techniques:

1.  Ask open-ended questions

    *   "Sounds like a tough deal. Tell me how it all happened."

        - Non-judgmental
        - Shows interest
        - Likely to lead to more information
    *   "Do you have a gun? What kind? How many bullets do you have?"

        - Forces one-word answers
        - Gives impression negotiator is more interested in gun than man
        - Communicates sense of urgency that builds (rather than defuses) tension

2.  Effective pauses

    Use it for emphasis, to encourage to someone to keep talking, or to defuse things when people get emotional.

3.  Minimal encourages

    Brief statements to let the person know you're listening and to keep them talking.

    * "yes", "ok", "i see"

4.  Mirroring.

    Repeat the last word or phrase the person said to show you're listening and engaged.

    *   Subject: "I'm sick and tired of being pushed around"
        Negotiator: "Feel pushed, huh?"

5.  Paraphrasing
    
    Repeat what the other person is saying back to them in your own words.

    Shows you really understand and aren't merely parroting.

6.  Emotional labeling

    Give their feelings a name.

    Don't comment on validity of feeling, btu show you understand.

    *   "You sound pretty hurt about being left. It doesn't seem fair."

        Recognizes feelings without judging them.

        Good Additive empathetic response. Identifities the hurt that underlies anger.
    *   "You don't need to feel that way. If he was messing around on you, he was not worth the energy."

        Poor repsonse.

        Judgmental. Tells the subject how not to feel. Minimizes subject's feeling which are a major part of who she is. Subtractive Empathy.
