Semantics
================================================================================

**Semantics** is the study of taking sentences_ and phrases and translating them
into thoughts and idea.

Semantics is the study of the sentence meaning.

Topics
================================================================================

The chief ideas used in semantics are reference and truth.

It is plausible that the function of language is to connect words with the
world.

The connection or relation between words and the world is said to involve
reference.

If the word of a sentence connect with world in the right sort of way, then it
it plausible that the sentence is true.

Analysis
================================================================================

Every theory of semantics consists of two parts:

1. Base rules: Rules that specify the meanings of the basic elements of the
   language

2. Projection rules: Rules that specify how the meaning of the complex sentence
   are determined

The simplest sentence are called atomic sentences and are defined as those
sentence of which no proper part is a sentence.
