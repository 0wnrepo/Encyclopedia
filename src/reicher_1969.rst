:Abstract:
    In this study, researchers investigate whether early perceptual recognition
    occurs in serial or parallel. The researchers investigated the question by
    flashing one or two of either letters, words, or non-words before subjects
    and then asking them to identify which letter was at a particular location
    between two alternatives. Subjects performed best on single words, which
    suggests that early perceptual recognition happens in parallel, but higher
    level processing happens in serial.

Introduction
================================================================================

Sperling showed after a very brief visual presentation of letters, |Ss|
initially have more information available than they can report. This suggests
that |Ss| have a limited capacity to `process`_ visual information and that
excess information is kept in (what Sperling calls) |VIS|_ to await processing.
Subjects lose information while it remains in |VIS|_ and it may be cleared by
`visual masking`_. Presumably, |VIS|_ does not detect words, so a `scanning
device`_ is proposed as well.  Evidence on whether the |SCAN|_ processes
information in serial or parallel is equivocal.  [*]_

Experiment
================================================================================

:Question:
    Does early analysis of visual information occur in serial or parallel?

:Intuition:
    Control two variables:

    #. `Stimulus duration`_

       1. |D_SHORT|_

       2. |D_MED|_

       3. |D_LONG|_

    #. `Type of material`_

       1. One letter

       2. Two letters

       3. One 4-letter word

       4. Two 4-letter words

       5. One 4-letter non-word

       6. Two 4-letter non-words

    Measure recognition performance on the different types of material.

:Predictions:
    If the serial model is right and processing time is the critical variable in
    the task, then:
    
    - Recognition performance in trials with a |D_LONG| should be better than in
      trials with a |D_SHORT|.

    - Recognition performance on single letters should be better than on single
      word and on single non-words.

    - Recognition performance on single items of any type should be be better
      than performance of two items of the same type.

:Experiment:
    Nine |Ss| participated in a group of trials for each `stimulus
    duration`_. Each group of trials had multiple stimulus items drawn equally
    from each `type of material`_.

    .. image:: http://www.yorku.ca/yul/gazette/past/archive/2000/022300/current/facial.jpg
    
    Each trial proceeded in four main parts:

    #. The |S| viewed a fixation point on a blank field through a
       `tachistoscope`_.

    #. The |S| viewed a stimulus display for the corresponding `stimulus
       duration`_ after signaling they were ready.

    #. The |S| viewed a `visual masking field`_, assumed to erase |VIS|_ (which
       would stop new processing), along with the two `response alternatives`_
       in a particular column.

    #. The |S| responded with the `response alternative`_ which they thought had
       appeared in that column in the stimulus display.

:Results:
    - Recognition performance in trials with a |D_LONG| was better than in
      trials with a |D_SHORT|.

    - Recognition performance on single words was better than either single
      letters or single non-words.

    - Recognition performance on single items of any type was better than
      performance of two items of the same type.

:Conclusion:
    We reject a serial model of processing of sensory information, since
    performance on words was better than performance on letters. [*]_ [*]_

    The interpretation that coded units or "chunks" might be handled serially
    remains plausible, since performance on one of each type of material was
    better than performance on two of that same type.

Footnotes
================================================================================

.. [*] 
    In the early version of Sperling's 1963 model, the |SCAN|_ operated in a
    serial manner. [#]_ Estes and Taylor 1966 have also reported data favoring a
    serial processing model. [#]_

    Sperling 1967 has more recently argued for a parallel mode of operation of
    the |SCAN|_. [#]_ Further support for parallel processing is given by data
    of Exp.  II of Estes and Taylor 1966. [#]_

.. [*]
    One possible explanation for the superiority of performance on words is
    suggested by the reports of some |Ss| that a single letter was harder to
    find in the field of the `tachistoscope`_ than four letters. If the process
    of perception can be broken down into detection and recognition with the
    completion of the former necessary before proceeding to the latter, the
    superior performance on words could be explained in terms of their increased
    detectability due to the greater area taken up by words.

.. [*]
    Another possible explanation for this is that letters are forgotten more
    quickly than words while in |VIS|_. The experimenters attempted to mitigate
    this possiblity by having the |E| inform half of the subjects of the
    `response alternatives`_ before the trial, but this was not successful, as
    informed |Ss| performed worse. It's unclear why informing subjects reduced
    performance. Under different conditions, the opposite result was found in
    other studies.

.. [#]
    This was suggested by an experiment in which a `visual masking field`_,
    assumed to erase |VIS|_, followed the stimulus display after various
    intervals. The function relating time between between the stimulus and the
    masking field to the number of letters correctly reported had a slope of 10
    msec per letter correctly reported.

.. [#]
    TODO: Support

.. [#]
    Although |Ss| performed better on one position of a tachistoscoptic
    display, all of the items in all positions had some probably of being
    reported correctly even after the shortest times were allowed for
    processing. This is unreasonable under a serial processing hypothesis.

    Sperling also notes that |Ss| can report the approximate number of
    items, and the colors, as well as the particular letters which have been
    cued.

.. [#]
    TODO: Support

.. [#]
    `Response alternatives`_ were directly above or below the position of the
    `critical letter`_ in the stimulus display depending on whether the
    `critical letter`_ had been in the top or bottom row of the display.

    .. compound:: For example::
        
           ___D
              K

     would indicate that the critical letter had been in the top row
     fourth column, and::

            O  
           _A__

     would indicate that the critical leter had been in the bottom row,
     second column.

     Note, underscores were used on the alternative card to indicate the
     relative position of the `critical letters`_ in the stimulus display.

Criticism
================================================================================

- The point on the subjects with the precue is confusing, especially in the case
  of single letters. If subjects were given the alternatives before the trial,
  then in the case of single letters it seems to me they should have only needed
  to identify it as one of the two they just heard. Yet the data shows that
  candidates did *worse* (as they did consistently in every case with the
  precue). The authors make little attempt to explain why this might be so and
  unsatisfyingly state they cannot explain it. It does not affect the nature of
  the results though.

- It is interesting to note that regardless of precue, the order of performance
  was consistent (though not the degree), namely: 1W, 1L, 1Q, 2W, 2L, 2Q.

- The authors admit the possibility that words are recognized better than single
  letters because words take up more relative space in the display. This is
  definitely true, but we can see that some other variable must be affecting the
  data, otherwise recognition performance of (1W and 1Q) and (2W and 2Q) should
  be identical.

Glossary
================================================================================

.. _critical letter:
.. _critical letters:

Critical letter
    In a `word stimuli`_, the letter which could be replaced to form a new word.
    
    The `critical letter`_ came from each of the four possible positions of the
    four letter words equally often.

.. _D_LONG:
.. _long duration:

Long duration
    The duration at which each subject performed at 90% accuracy (uncorrected
    for chance) in identifying single letters from two response alternatives.

.. _D_MED:

|D_MED|
    The duration lying midway between the |D_SHORT|_ and the |D_LONG|_.

.. _D_SHORT:
.. _short duration:

Short duration
    The duration at which each subject performed at 60% accuracy (uncorrected
    for chance) in identifying single letters from two response alternatives.

.. _precue:
.. _precue condition:
.. _precue conditions:
.. _no-precue:
.. _no-precue condition:
.. _no-precue conditions:

Precue condition
    In an attempt to reduce the confounding of perceptual effects with memory
    effects, a condition was added in which the two alternatives were given in
    advance of the presentation of the stimulus display. With this information,
    |Ss| would presumably have to remember only the target item so that memory
    loss would not confused the results.

    On alternate days, |Ss| were given the two alternative letters verbally
    before each stimulus exposure and repeated them. This verbal information
    before each trial was the only difference in treatment for the conditions
    where |Ss| had information before the trial (precue) as opposed to the
    condition where did not have such information (no precue).

.. _process:
.. _processing:

Processing
    Any operation performed on input information and not just to those
    operations that require attention.

.. _response alternative:
.. _response alternatives:

Response alternative
    The `critical letter`_ as well as its substitute, were the two response
    alternatives in the forced-choice procedure. For example, ``D`` and ``K``
    were the alternatives for the word ``WORD`` with ``D`` being the critical
    letter.

.. _scan:
.. _scanning device:

Scanning device
    A mental device that tells whether a particular figure is a letter or some
    other figure or whether letters make a word or not.

    Selects information from |VIS|_ and passes it on for further processing.

.. _stimulus duration:
.. _stimulus durations:

Stimulus duration
    The length of time the stimulus display was presented.

    The three stimulus durations were determined separately for each |S|.

    In the first session of the experiment, the |D_LONG|_  was determined.

    In the second session of the experiment, the |D_SHORT|_  was determined.
    
    The actual durations used for each |S| were the |D_SHORT|_, the |D_LONG|_,
    and a |D_MED|_.

.. _tachistoscope:
.. _tachistoscoptic display:

Tachistoscoptic display
    A tachistoscope is a device that displays an image for a specific amount of
    time. It can be used to increase recognition speed, to show something too
    fast to be consciously recognized, or to test which parts of an image are
    memorable. Tachistoscopes were used extensively in psychological research
    before computers became ubiquitous.

.. _word stimuli:
.. _type of material:
.. _types of material:

Type of material
    Four types of stimuli were presented:

    1. Four-letter word
    2. Four-letter non-word
    3. One letter
    4. Two letter

    (1) were 216 4-letter words chosen such that each of the words could be
    changed by one letter to make up a new word.

    (2) were anagrams of (1) with the `critical letter`_ held in the same
    position.

    (3) were made up by using the same `critical letters`_ in the same positions
    as were used in (1).

.. _vis:
.. _visual information storage:

Visual information storage
    A mental storage system in which information loss takes place.

    Sperling suggests it is a fast-decaying system for storing sensory
    information (e.g. information which has not made contract with the central
    processor or long-term memory).
    
    Presumably the |VIS| does not perform the same operations as the |SCAN|_.

.. _visual masking:
.. _visual masking field:

Visual masking
    A reduction in the detectability of a brief visual stimulus by the
    presentation of a second stimulus (the masking stimulus).
