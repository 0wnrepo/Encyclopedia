Introduction
============

After a very brief visual presentation of letters, subjects initially have more
information available than they can report. This suggests that subjects have a
limited capacity to handle information so that when they are asked to report all
of the items in a stimulus display, they lose information while they are
responding.

.. _scan:
.. _scanning device:

Scanning device
    Selects information from the VIS and and passes it on for further
    processing.

.. _vis:
.. _visual information storage:

Visual information storage
    A storage system in which information loss takes place.

    Sperling suggests it is a fast-decaying system for storing sensory
    information (e.g. information which has not made contract with the central
    processor or long-term memory).

    Presumably, VIS does not contain the information necessary to tell whether a
    particular figure is a letter or some other figure or whether letters make a
    word or not.
