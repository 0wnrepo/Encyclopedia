:Abstract:
    In this study, researchers investigate whether early perceptual recognition
    occurs in serial or parallel. Up to 1969, evidence for both had been
    equivocal. The researchers investigated the question by flashing one or two
    of either letters, words, or non-words before subjects and then asking them
    to choose between two single-letter responses to identify a letter at a
    particular location. Subjects performed best when asked to recall letters
    from single words, which suggests that early perceptual recognition happens
    in parallel, but higher level processing happens in serial.

Introduction
================================================================================

Sperling showed after a very brief visual presentation of letters, |Ss|
initially have more information available than they can report. This suggests
that |Ss| have a limited capacity to handle information so that when they
are asked to report all of the items in a stimulus display, they lose
information while they are responding. Sperling called the storage system in
which this take places `visual information storage`_. Presumably, |VIS|_ cannot
detect words, so a `scanning device`_ is proposed as well.

Sperling's model is based on an earlier model. Both have a sensory storage
system to hold information until the central processor is free to handle it, an
attentional mechanism selecting the information to be processed while holding
the remainder in the sensory storage system, and a limited capacity processing
system.

The evidence on whether early analysis of visual information occurs in serial or
parallel is equivocal.

- In the early version of Sperling's 1963 model, the |SCAN|_ operated in a
  serial manner. [#]_ Estes and Taylor 1966 have also reported data favoring a
  serial processing model. [#]_

- Sperling 1967 has more recently argued for a parallel, rather than a serial,
  mode of operation of the |SCAN|_. [#]_ Further support for parallel processing
  is given by data of Exp. II of Estes and Taylor 1966. [#]_

Experiment
================================================================================

:Question:
    Does early analysis of visual information occur in serial or parallel?

:Hypothesis:
    Evidence is equivocal.

:Prediction:
    If we accept the assumption that processing time is the critical variable in
    the task and is a monotonic function of the time between the onset of the
    stimulus and the onset of the masking field, we must predict that single
    words are processed faster than single letters.

:Experiment:
    Measure recognition performance on one or two letter, four-letter words, and
    four-letter non-words.

    9 |Ss| participated in 2 sessions over two days.
    
    3 variables were controlled:

    1. `Stimulus duration`_

       1. |D_SHORT|_

       2. |D_MED|_

       3. |D_LONG|_

    2. `Precue conditions`_

       1. `precue`_

       2. `no-precue`_

    3. `Type of material`_

       1. One letter

       2. Two letters

       3. One 4-letter word

       4. Two 4-letter words

       5. One 4-letter non-word

       6. Two 4-letter non-words
    
    In the first session, 4 |Ss| received the `precue condition`_ and 5 |Ss|
    received the `no-precue condition`_. In the second session, the `precue
    conditions`_ were inverted.

    In each session, the |S| was presented with three blocks of `trials`_
    corresponding to one of the three `stimulus durations`_ (the ordering was
    chosen at random for each |S| from one of the six possible orderings).

    Each block contained eight stimulus items from each of the six `types
    of material`_ with the `critical letter`_ in a different position, for a
    total of 48 stimulus items.

    The stimulus items were then ordered randomly and the subject ran through
    each in a `trial`_.
    
    .. _trial:
    .. _trials:

    A trial consisted of a |S| and an |E| at a `tachistoscope`_ and proceeded in
    four parts:

    1. A fixation point was displayed on a blank field

    2. The stimulus display was displayed after being initiated by a |S|
       after a ready signal from the |E|.

    3. A `visual masking field`_ was displayed along with the two `response
       alternatives`_. [#]_

    4. The |S| responded with the `response alternative`_ which they thought had
       appeared in the stimulus display.

:Results:
    - |Ss| did worse in the `precue condition`_ than in the `no-precue
      condition`_.

    - |Ss| did better in the |D_LONG| than the |D_SHORT|.

    - Performance on one word was better than either one letter on one non-word.

    - Performance on two words was better than either two letters or two
      non-words.
    
    - Performance on one ``X`` cases was better than two ``X`` cases.

:Conclusion:
    We reject a system for serial processing of sensory information, as |Ss| did
    better in the one word tests than one letter.

    In that performance on two of each type of material was worse than
    performance on one of that same type, the interpretation that coded units or
    "chunks" might be handled serially remains tenable.

:Discussion:
    One possible explanation for the superiority of performance on words is that
    letters are forgotten more quickly than words. The attempt to reduce the
    memory load by giving |Ss| the response alternatives before presentation of
    the stimulus display was not successful.

    A second possibility is suggested by the reports of some |Ss| that a single
    letter was hard to find in the field of the tachistoscope than four letters.
    If the process of perception can be broken down into detection and
    recognition with the completion of the former necessary before proceeding to
    the latter, the superior performance on words could be explained in terms of
    their increased detectability due to the greater are take up by words than
    by letters.

    The data of the present experiment do not suggest any promising explanations
    of why prior information interfered with performance. Under somewhat
    different conditions, the opposite result has been found in other studies.

Glossary
================================================================================

.. _critical letter:
.. _critical letters:

Critical letter
    In a `word stimuli`_, the letter which could be replaced to form a new word.
    
    The `critical letter`_ came from each of the four possible positions of the
    four letter words equally often.

.. _D_LONG:
.. _long duration:

Long duration
    The duration at which each subject performed at 90% accuracy (uncorrected
    for chance) in identifying single letters from two response alternatives.

.. _D_MED:

|D_MED|
    The duration lying midway between the |D_SHORT|_ and the |D_LONG|_.

.. _D_SHORT:
.. _short duration:

Short duration
    The duration at which each subject performed at 60% accuracy (uncorrected
    for chance) in identifying single letters from two response alternatives.

.. _precue:
.. _precue condition:
.. _precue conditions:
.. _no-precue:
.. _no-precue condition:
.. _no-precue conditions:

Precue condition
    In an attempt to reduce the confounding of perceptual effects with memory
    effects, a condition was added in which the two alternatives were given in
    advance of the presentation of the stimulus display. With this information,
    |Ss| would presumably have to remember only the target item so that memory
    loss would not confused the results.

    On alternate days, |Ss| were given the two alternative letters verbally
    before each stimulus exposure and repeated them. This verbal information
    before each `trial`_ was the only difference in treatment for the conditions
    where |Ss| had information before the `trial`_ (precue) as opposed to the
    condition where did not have such information (no precue).

.. _processing:

Processing
    Any operation performed on input information and not just to those
    operations that require attention.

.. _response alternative:
.. _response alternatives:

Response alternative
    The `critical letter`_ as well as its substitute, were the two response
    alternatives in the forced-choice procedure. For example, ``D`` and ``K``
    were the alternatives for the word ``WORD`` with ``D`` being the critical
    letter.

.. _scan:
.. _scanning device:

Scanning device
    A mental device that tells whether a particular figure is a letter or some
    other figure or whether letters make a word or not.

    Selects information from |VIS|_ and passes it on for further processing.

.. _stimulus duration:
.. _stimulus durations:

Stimulus duration
    The length of time the stimulus display was presented.

    The three stimulus durations were determined separately for each |S|.

    In the first session of the experiment, the |D_LONG|_  was determined.

    In the second session of the experiment, the |D_SHORT|_  was determined.
    
    The actual durations used for each |S| were the |D_SHORT|_, the |D_LONG|_,
    and a |D_MED|_.

.. _tachistoscope:
.. _tachistoscoptic display:

Tachistoscoptic display
    A tachistoscope is a device that displays an image for a specific amount of
    time. It can be used to increase recognition speed, to show something too
    fast to be consciously recognized, or to test which parts of an image are
    memorable. Tachistoscopes were used extensively in psychological research
    before computers became ubiquitous.

.. _word stimuli:
.. _type of material:
.. _types of material:

Type of material
    Four types of stimuli were presented:

    1. Four-letter word
    2. Four-letter non-word
    3. One letter
    4. Two letter

    (1) were 216 4-letter words chosen such that each of the words could be
    changed by one letter to make up a new word.

    (2) were anagrams of (1) with the `critical letter`_ held in the same
    position.

    (3) were made up by using the same `critical letters`_ in the same positions
    as were used in (1).

.. _vis:
.. _visual information storage:

Visual information storage
    A mental storage system in which information loss takes place.

    Sperling suggests it is a fast-decaying system for storing sensory
    information (e.g. information which has not made contract with the central
    processor or long-term memory).
    
    Presumably the |VIS| does not perform the same operations as the |SCAN|_.

.. _visual masking:
.. _visual masking field:

Visual masking
    A reduction in the detectability of a brief visual stimulus (the test
    stimulus) by the presentation of a second stimulus (the masking stimulus).

Footnotes
================================================================================

.. [#]
    This was suggested by an experiment in which a `visual masking field`_,
    assumed to erase |VIS|_, followed the stimulus display after various
    intervals. The function relating time between between the stimulus and the
    masking field to the number of letters correctly reported had a slope of 10
    msec per letter correctly reported.

.. [#]
    TODO: Support

.. [#]
    Although |Ss| performed better on one position of a tachistoscoptic
    display, all of the items in all positions had some probably of being
    reported correctly even after the shortest times were allowed for
    processing. This is unreasonable under a serial processing hypothesis.

    Sperling also notes that |Ss| can report the approximate number of
    items, and the colors, as well as the particular letters which have been
    cued.

.. [#]
    TODO: Support

.. [#]
    `Response alternatives`_ were directly above or below the position of the
    `critical letter`_ in the stimulus display depending on whether the
    `critical letter`_ had been in the top or bottom row of the display.

    .. compound:: For example::
        
           ___D
              K

     would indicate that the critical letter had been in the top row
     fourth column, and::

            O  
           _A__

     would indicate that the critical leter had been in the bottom row,
     second column.

     Note, underscores were used on the alternative card to indicate the
     relative position of the `critical letters`_ in the stimulus display.
