:Abstract:
    In this study, researchers investigate whether early perceptual recognition
    occurs in serial or parallel. The researchers investigated the question by
    flashing one or two of either letters, words, or non-words before subjects
    and then asking them to identify which letter was at a particular location
    between two alternatives. Subjects performed best on single words, which
    suggests that early perceptual recognition happens in parallel, but higher
    level processing happens in serial.

Introduction
================================================================================

Sperling showed after a very brief visual presentation of letters, |Ss|
initially have more information available than they can report. This suggests
that |Ss| have a limited capacity to `process`_ information and that they store
information in some storage system before processing, which Sperling calls
|VIS|_. Subjects lose information while it remains in |VIS|_. Presumably, |VIS|_
does not detect words, so a `scanning device`_ is proposed as well.  Evidence on
whether the |SCAN|_ processes information in serial or parallel is equivocal.

Experiment
================================================================================

:Question:
    Does early analysis of visual information occur in serial or parallel?

:Test:
    Measure recognition performance on one or two letter, four-letter words, and
    four-letter non-words.

:Prediction:
    If we accept the assumption that processing time is the critical variable in
    the task and is a monotonic function of the time between the onset of the
    stimulus and the onset of the masking field, we must predict that single
    words are processed faster than single letters.

:Experiment:
    9 |Ss| participated in 2 sessions over two days.
    
    3 variables were controlled:

    1. `Stimulus duration`_

       1. |D_SHORT|_

       2. |D_MED|_

       3. |D_LONG|_

    2. `Precue conditions`_

       1. Informed of `response alternatives`_ beforehand

       1. Not informed of `response alternatives`_ beforehand

    3. `Type of material`_

       1. One letter

       2. Two letters

       3. One 4-letter word

       4. Two 4-letter words

       5. One 4-letter non-word

       6. Two 4-letter non-words
    
    In the first session, half of the |Ss| received the `precue condition`_ and
    the other half received the `no-precue condition`_. In the second session,
    the `precue conditions`_ were inverted.

    In each session, the |S| was presented with three arrays of `trials`_
    corresponding to the three `stimulus durations`_ in random order.

    Each array contained a total of 48 randomly arranged stimulus items, eight
    from each of the six `types of material`_, with the `critical letter`_
    appearing once in each of the eight possible positions for each type.
    
    .. _trial:
    .. _trials:

    The subject was tested on each stimulus item for each array in a series of
    `trials`_.

    A trial consisted of a |E| and an |S| at a `tachistoscope`_.

    Each trial proceeded in four main parts:

    #. If the subject had the `precue condition`_, the |E| informed them of the
       two `response alternatives`_.

    #. The |S| viewed a fixation point on a blank field.

    #. The |S| viewed a stimulus display for the corresponding `stimulus
       duration`_ after signaling they were ready.

    #. The |S| viewed a `visual masking field`_, assumed to erase |VIS|_ (which
       would stop new processing), along with the two `response alternatives`_
       in a particular column.

    #. The |S| responded with the `response alternative`_ which they thought had
       appeared in that column in the stimulus display.

:Results:
    - Performance on one word was better than either one letter on one non-word.

    - Performance on two words was better than either two letters or two
      non-words.
    
    - Performance on one of each type of material was better than performance on
      two of that same type.

    - |Ss| did better in the |D_LONG|_ than the |D_SHORT|_.

    - |Ss| did worse in the `precue condition`_ than in the `no-precue
      condition`_.

:Conclusion:
    We reject a system for serial processing of sensory information, as
    performance on words was better than performance on letters.

    The interpretation that coded units or "chunks" might be handled serially
    remains tenable, as performance on one of each type of material was
    better than performance on two of that same type.

:Discussion:
    One possible explanation for the superiority of performance on words is that
    letters are forgotten more quickly than words. The attempt to reduce the
    memory load by giving |Ss| the response alternatives before presentation of
    the stimulus display was not successful.

    A second possibility is suggested by the reports of some |Ss| that a single
    letter was hard to find in the field of the tachistoscope than four letters.
    If the process of perception can be broken down into detection and
    recognition with the completion of the former necessary before proceeding to
    the latter, the superior performance on words could be explained in terms of
    their increased detectability due to the greater are take up by words than
    by letters.

    The data of the present experiment do not suggest any promising explanations
    of why prior information interfered with performance. Under somewhat
    different conditions, the opposite result has been found in other studies.

Glossary
================================================================================

.. _critical letter:
.. _critical letters:

Critical letter
    In a `word stimuli`_, the letter which could be replaced to form a new word.
    
    The `critical letter`_ came from each of the four possible positions of the
    four letter words equally often.

.. _D_LONG:
.. _long duration:

Long duration
    The duration at which each subject performed at 90% accuracy (uncorrected
    for chance) in identifying single letters from two response alternatives.

.. _D_MED:

|D_MED|
    The duration lying midway between the |D_SHORT|_ and the |D_LONG|_.

.. _D_SHORT:
.. _short duration:

Short duration
    The duration at which each subject performed at 60% accuracy (uncorrected
    for chance) in identifying single letters from two response alternatives.

.. _precue:
.. _precue condition:
.. _precue conditions:
.. _no-precue:
.. _no-precue condition:
.. _no-precue conditions:

Precue condition
    In an attempt to reduce the confounding of perceptual effects with memory
    effects, a condition was added in which the two alternatives were given in
    advance of the presentation of the stimulus display. With this information,
    |Ss| would presumably have to remember only the target item so that memory
    loss would not confused the results.

    On alternate days, |Ss| were given the two alternative letters verbally
    before each stimulus exposure and repeated them. This verbal information
    before each `trial`_ was the only difference in treatment for the conditions
    where |Ss| had information before the `trial`_ (precue) as opposed to the
    condition where did not have such information (no precue).

.. _process:
.. _processing:

Processing
    Any operation performed on input information and not just to those
    operations that require attention.

.. _response alternative:
.. _response alternatives:

Response alternative
    The `critical letter`_ as well as its substitute, were the two response
    alternatives in the forced-choice procedure. For example, ``D`` and ``K``
    were the alternatives for the word ``WORD`` with ``D`` being the critical
    letter.

.. _scan:
.. _scanning device:

Scanning device
    A mental device that tells whether a particular figure is a letter or some
    other figure or whether letters make a word or not.

    Selects information from |VIS|_ and passes it on for further processing.

.. _stimulus duration:
.. _stimulus durations:

Stimulus duration
    The length of time the stimulus display was presented.

    The three stimulus durations were determined separately for each |S|.

    In the first session of the experiment, the |D_LONG|_  was determined.

    In the second session of the experiment, the |D_SHORT|_  was determined.
    
    The actual durations used for each |S| were the |D_SHORT|_, the |D_LONG|_,
    and a |D_MED|_.

.. _tachistoscope:
.. _tachistoscoptic display:

Tachistoscoptic display
    A tachistoscope is a device that displays an image for a specific amount of
    time. It can be used to increase recognition speed, to show something too
    fast to be consciously recognized, or to test which parts of an image are
    memorable. Tachistoscopes were used extensively in psychological research
    before computers became ubiquitous.

.. _word stimuli:
.. _type of material:
.. _types of material:

Type of material
    Four types of stimuli were presented:

    1. Four-letter word
    2. Four-letter non-word
    3. One letter
    4. Two letter

    (1) were 216 4-letter words chosen such that each of the words could be
    changed by one letter to make up a new word.

    (2) were anagrams of (1) with the `critical letter`_ held in the same
    position.

    (3) were made up by using the same `critical letters`_ in the same positions
    as were used in (1).

.. _vis:
.. _visual information storage:

Visual information storage
    A mental storage system in which information loss takes place.

    Sperling suggests it is a fast-decaying system for storing sensory
    information (e.g. information which has not made contract with the central
    processor or long-term memory).
    
    Presumably the |VIS| does not perform the same operations as the |SCAN|_.

.. _visual masking:
.. _visual masking field:

Visual masking
    A reduction in the detectability of a brief visual stimulus (the test
    stimulus) by the presentation of a second stimulus (the masking stimulus).

.. [*] 

   - In the early version of Sperling's 1963 model, the |SCAN|_ operated in a
     serial manner. [#]_ Estes and Taylor 1966 have also reported data favoring
     a serial processing model. [#]_

   - Sperling 1967 has more recently argued for a parallel mode of operation of
     the |SCAN|_. [#]_ Further support for parallel processing is given by data
     of Exp.  II of Estes and Taylor 1966. [#]_

.. [#]
    This was suggested by an experiment in which a `visual masking field`_,
    assumed to erase |VIS|_, followed the stimulus display after various
    intervals. The function relating time between between the stimulus and the
    masking field to the number of letters correctly reported had a slope of 10
    msec per letter correctly reported.

.. [#]
    TODO: Support

.. [#]
    Although |Ss| performed better on one position of a tachistoscoptic
    display, all of the items in all positions had some probably of being
    reported correctly even after the shortest times were allowed for
    processing. This is unreasonable under a serial processing hypothesis.

    Sperling also notes that |Ss| can report the approximate number of
    items, and the colors, as well as the particular letters which have been
    cued.

.. [#]
    TODO: Support

.. [#]
    `Response alternatives`_ were directly above or below the position of the
    `critical letter`_ in the stimulus display depending on whether the
    `critical letter`_ had been in the top or bottom row of the display.

    .. compound:: For example::
        
           ___D
              K

     would indicate that the critical letter had been in the top row
     fourth column, and::

            O  
           _A__

     would indicate that the critical leter had been in the bottom row,
     second column.

     Note, underscores were used on the alternative card to indicate the
     relative position of the `critical letters`_ in the stimulus display.
